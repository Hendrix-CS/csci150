\* <i>Technically this lab is due before you leave for Thanksgiving; but the
intention is that you should be able to finish it during the 3-hour lab
period on Nov 14/15.</i>

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be
through weekly labs, which will comprise 25% of your final grade. Each
lab will be assigned Wednesday/Thursday in lab with time allotted to
work through the materials, and will be due by **the start of the
following lab**. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion
of your final grade.

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester
as they wish.  Simply inform **the grader**
(<tt>DenneyJM@hendrix.edu</tt>) any time *prior* to the due date for
an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in
the assignment up to 24 hours late.  Multiple late days may be used on
the same assignment.  There are no partial late days; turning in an
assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day.
Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances
(you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional
circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or family obligation,
*etc.*).  Aside from late days, late assignments will not be accepted.

On these labs, you may work with a partner on the lab assignments if
you choose. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint
work.  A partnership need only turn in a single copy of the
assignment.  If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab
late, *both* students must use a late day.

**Lab attendance is required.** Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer
Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the
library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic
Resource Center, through this door:

Continue through the door at the far end of the hall (just visible in
the picture above) into the first computer lab, and then enter the
second lab at the back.

You will be handing in your lab work electronically. Instructions on
how to do so will be included in each lab.

Labs should follow
the
[Python style guide](http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html).
You may use
the
[automated style checker](http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html) to
help you catch common style errors.
