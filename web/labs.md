 <!-- \* <i>Technically this lab is due before you leave for Thanksgiving; but the -->
 <!-- intention is that you should be able to finish it during the 3-hour lab -->
 <!-- period on Nov 14/15.</i> -->

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be
through weekly labs, which will comprise 25% of your final grade. Each
lab will be assigned Wednesday/Thursday in lab with time allotted to
work through the materials, and will be due by **the start of the
following lab**. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion
of your final grade.

On these labs, you may work with a partner on the lab assignments if
you choose. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint
work.  A partnership should only turn in a <b>single copy</b> of the
assignment.  If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab
late, *both* students must use a late day.

**Lab attendance is required.** Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer
Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the
library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic
Resource Center, through this door:

Continue through the door at the far end of the hall (just visible in
the picture above) into the first computer lab, and then enter the
second lab at the back.

Labs should follow
the
[Python style guide](http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html).
You may use
the
[automated style checker](http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html) to
help you catch common style errors.
