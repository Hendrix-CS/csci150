title: Labs
---

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through
weekly labs, which will comprise 25% of your final grade. Each lab will
be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and
will be due by Friday at 4pm. All labs are weighted equally within the
lab portion of your final grade.

**Lab attendance is required.** Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer
Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the
library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic
Resource Center, through this door:

Continue through the door at the far end of the hall (just visible in
the picture above) into the first computer lab, and then enter the
second lab at the back.

You will be handing in your lab work via
[Moodle](http://moodle.hendrix.edu). Instructions to do so will be
included in each lab.

On these labs, you may work with a partner on the lab assignments if you
choose. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work.
