title: Projects
---

You will have three projects in this course, one about every five weeks,
for a total of 35% of your final grade. These projects will cover
concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due
approximately one week after they are assigned.

**You must work individually on the first two projects**. You may
discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn
in must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but
also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further
details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each
project will be given when they are assigned.
