title: Quizzes and HW
---

Sporadically throughout the semester, there will be short quizzes
covering material from the previous class. You are encouraged to attend
class and actively participate in discussions every day (answering
questions, asking questions, presenting material, etc.)

There will also often be short homework assignments to be completed
over the weekend.

These quizzes, participation, and homework assignments will comprise
15% of your final grade.
