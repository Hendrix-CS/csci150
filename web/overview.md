### Overview

Introduction to solving computational problems, including the
fundamentals of computer programming. Topics include imperative
programming constructs (variables, loops, conditionals, functions,
recursion), basic object-oriented constructs (classes, objects), and
some fundamental algorithms and data structures (dictionaries, arrays,
linked lists, basic sorting). Student learn these concepts through
studying the Python programming language.

At the end of the course, you will be expected to be able to:

-   Read, understand and execute a computer program written in Python.
-   Read a set of requirements for a computer program in English, and
    write a short Python program (100 lines or less) that corresponds to
    them.
-   Test a Python program and identify and fix programming errors.
-   Identify some errors in a Python program without testing it.
-   Without using a computer, write a very short Python code fragment
    (10 lines or less) that correctly implements a set of requirements.
-   Understand and apply variables, loops, strings, lists, conditionals,
    and functions.
-   Write programs to perform mathematical calculations.
-   Understand the concept of a module.
-   Write a Python program that is separated into at least two modules.
-   Understand the concepts of class and object, and distinguish between
    them.
-   Write a Python program including objects of at least one
    student-designed class.
-   Write and understand appropriate comments in a Python program.
-   Understand the concept of an algorithm and compare the efficiency of
    different algorithms for a simple task.

### Disabilities

It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with
disabilities, pursuant to federal and state law. Students should contact
Julie Brown in the Office of Academic Success (505.2954;
`brownj@hendrix.edu`) to begin the accommodation process. Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should
inform the instructor at the beginning of the course.

### Academic Honor

XXXX

As stated in the [Hendrix Academic Integrity
Policy](http://www.hendrix.edu/studentlife/handbook.aspx?id=67121), all
students have agreed to adhere to the following principles:

-   All students have an equal right to their opinions and to receive
    constructive criticism.
-   Students should positively engage the course material and encourage
    their classmates to do the same.
-   No students should gain an unfair advantage or violate their peers'
    commitment to honest work and genuine effort. It follows that any
    work that a student submits for class will be that student's own
    work. The amount of cooperation undertaken with other students, the
    consistency and accuracy of work, and the test-taking procedure
    should adhere to those guidelines that the instructor provides.
-   Members of the Hendrix community value and uphold academic integrity
    because we recognize that scholarly pursuits are aimed at increasing
    the shared body of knowledge and that the full disclosure of sources
    is the most effective way to ensure accountability to both ourselves
    and our colleagues.

We will provide guidelines for the amount of cooperation allowed on each
assignment as they are posted. In general, you may discuss topics with
other students and tutors, but **all code you write must be your own,
and you must be able to explain to your instructor how it works. In this
course, it is a violation of the honor code to look at code from other
students.**

### Extensions

Extensions and rescheduling for labs, projects, exams and quizzes are
only given when circumstances beyond your control (e.g. being sick,
choir or sports travel) prevent you from completing a project on time.
You must notify your instructor either by email or phone of your
circumstances well in advance of the due date. No extensions are given
for requests made within three days of the due date.
