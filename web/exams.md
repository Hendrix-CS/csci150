There will be three in-class exams, the first worth 5% and the last
two each worth 10% of your final grade. They will consist of short
answer questions along with writing and debugging code.

-   Exam 1: Wednesday, February 8, covering input/output, math, numerical data,
    conditionals, and binary encoding ([Practice exam](static/exam1-practice.pdf))
-   Exam 2: March (TBA), covering functions, while and for loops, lists and
    strings
-   Exam 3: April (TBA), covering recursion, dictionaries and object-oriented
    programming

There is no final exam; you will complete a final project instead, as
described above under Projects.
