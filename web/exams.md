There will be three in-class exams, the first worth 5% and the last two
each worth 10% of your final grade. They will consist of short answer
along with writing and debugging code.

-   Exam 1: Monday, February 8, covering input/output, math, numerical data and
    conditionals
-   Exam 2: Monday, March 7, covering functions, while and for loops, lists and
    strings
-   Exam 3: Friday, April 22, covering recursion, dictionaries and object-oriented
    programming

There is no final exam; you will complete a final project instead, as
described above under Projects.
