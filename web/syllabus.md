We will be covering most of the material in the textbook, approximately
one new chapter each week. You should view your textbook as another
perspective on the material presented in class and covered in the labs.
We will also be using additional supplemental material such as relevant
web-pages and background material for the lab assignments. Readings will
be assigned before material will be covered in class. You are expected
to review the material and come to class prepared.
