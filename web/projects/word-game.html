<h1><a href="/index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Project 2<br>Word Games</h1>
<h3>Assigned Monday, October 22<br>
Due Friday, November 2</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

For this project, we will explore more complex interactions with the user by implementing
control statements and loops. You will create a program for users to play a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game">word game</a> of your choice.
<p>
In particular, your project should be complex enough that it includes
the following concepts we have discussed in class:
<ul>
	<li>Booleans
	<li>Functions
	<li>Control Statements
	<li>While Loops
	<li>For Loops
	<li>Strings
	<li>Lists
</ul>
(It is not an absolute requirement for your program to contain every
single one of the above elements; but if it does not need most of
them, then your program is probably not interesting/complex enough.)

The game can be for one person against a computer, or two players
against each other.
<p>
Some examples are
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.greatschools.org/students/activities/slideshows/2812-family-word-games.gs?page=3">Last Letter First Letter</a> using Countries, State Names, Foods, etc.
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows">Bulls and
    Cows</a> (the version with words, not numbers)
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_%28game%29">Ghost</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">Boggle</a>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble">Scrabble</a>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39635/prolix">Prolix</a>
<li>a program to let a user solve
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram">Cryptogram</a>
</ul>
Do not feel limited by the games on this list. Find a game that
interests you and implement it. If you choose something else, check
with one of your instructors first, so we can advise you on the scope
of your project.
<p>
You should explain the game to the user, being clear exactly what
input is expected and valid whenever requesting information from them.
<p>
The user must be able to
<li>choose a level of difficulty for the game,
<li>be offered the chance to play the game again when finished, and
<li>make mistakes in entry of information and be prompted to correct their input.
<p>
Your code must make good use of functions. Using functions will reduce
the amount of code you need to write as well as make your program
easier to debug.

<h2>Warnings</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Get started early</b>!  Pick a game and run it by me.  I am happy to help
  you think through the design of your program.</li>

<li>If you are not confident with the use of functions to structure your
code, I highly recommend <i>first</i> getting something very basic to
work without using functions, then thinking about how to abstract
parts of your code into functions.  Then repeat the process, adding
  functionality incrementally.</li>

<li>Historically, project 2 is the point in the semester where
  students occasionally become <b>tempted to cheat</b> by copying
  others' code.  Do not succumb to this temptation!  Get started
  early, come for help often.  You <b>can</b> do this project!</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
You must hand in all files necessary to run your code.
<p>
Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
