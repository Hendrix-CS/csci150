# Things with strings

# 1. We can concatenate strings with +
# 2. We can replicate a string with  int * str
#    e.g. 5 * 'hello'

# 3. We can get the character at a particular index
#    with e.g.  'hello'[1]
#    (indices start at 0).

# 4. We can get the length of a string with the len() function

# 5. The last character is at index -1; negative indices count backwards
#    from the end of the string.

# 6. We can get a piece of a string ('slice') by writing
#    string[a:b], which gives us everything starting at index a
#    up to **but not including** index b.
