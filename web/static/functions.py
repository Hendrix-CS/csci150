# Functions
#
# Examples we've seen:
#
#   - print(...)  takes one thing as input and prints it on the screen
#   - input(...)  takes a string as input, prompts the user, and returns as output whatever they type.

# We can make our own functions!


# Say hi two times.
def say_hi_twice():
    say_hi()
    say_hi()

# Greets the user, asks their name, and ignores it.
def say_hi():   # inputs go in the parentheses
    print("Hello there CSCI 150!")
    print("This is a function.")
    input("What is your name? ")
    print("Whatever.")
    print(5/0)
