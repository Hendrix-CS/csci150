<h2 id="csci-150-hw-minecraft">CSCI 150 HW: Minecraft</h2>
<p><em>Due: Monday, January 22</em></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Consider the world shown above. Your task is to write a program to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine at least 4 redstone (the blocks with red dots)</li>
<li>Build a train track from in front of your character's starting location to the star.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember not to fall in the lava!</p>
<p>You may use any of the instructions you remember from the Minecraft lab. If you don't remember how the instructions work, you can try them out on code.org. Ultimately, you should make sure you write down any assumptions you make. As one simple example, when you &quot;place track&quot;, does the track appear in the square your character is on, or in the square in front of your character? You can either play with the command on code.org to figure it out, or just make a reasonable guess and write down your assumption.</p>
<p>You may write your program by hand, or type it and print it out. Either way, you should <strong>bring a physical copy of your homework to class on Monday</strong>.</p>
