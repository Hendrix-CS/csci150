<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> Lab 7: Line Editor</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

In this lab, you will practice using lists and strings in
Python by implementing a very simple text editor, which allows you to
create and edit text files one line at a time.  This kind of editor,
called a <em>line editor</em>, used to be the standard way to interact
with a text file in the 1970's, when communication from computers to
users tended to be via printers instead of screens.

<pre>
> Hi there!
> I am adding stuff
> to a file
> print
 0: Hi there!
 1: I am adding stuff
*2: to a file
> append yes I am
> print
 0: Hi there!
 1: I am adding stuff
 2: to a file
*3: yes I am
> find am
> print
 0: Hi there!
*1: I am adding stuff
 2: to a file
 3: yes I am
> replace I was adding stuff
> print
 0: Hi there!
*1: I was adding stuff
 2: to a file
 3: yes I am
> next
> print
 0: Hi there!
 1: I was adding stuff
 2: to a file
*3: yes I am
> insert This is a newly inserted line
> print
 0: Hi there!
 1: I was adding stuff
 2: to a file
*3: This is a newly inserted line
 4: yes I am
> line 0
> delete
> print
*0: I was adding stuff
 1: to a file
 2: This is a newly inserted line
 3: yes I am
> save stuff.txt
Saving as stuff.txt...
> quit
</pre>

<h2>Step 1: Accumulation</h2>

Create a new Python file called <code>line_editor.py</code>, and put
your name, date, copyright notice, <em>etc.</em> at the top. Also,
don't forget to include the line
<pre>
from typing import *
</pre>
which you will need in order to write type signatures involving lists.

<p>Define a <code>main()</code> function (and also call it as the very
last line in your file) which performs as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Create a variable containing a list of strings which will store
    the lines of the current document.  It should start out as the
    empty list.
  </li>

  <li>As long as the user isn't done, prompt them for a line of text
    (using the character <code>&gt;</code> as a prompt) and append
    whatever they type to the current document.  The user can indicate
    they are done by typing <code>quit</code>.
  </li>

  <li>After the user quits, print out the current document
    line-by-line, with each line prefixed by its index and a colon, as
    shown below.  The document should not include the
    final <code>quit</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

For example:

<pre>
> Hello
> there
> lab 7
> quit
0: Hello
1: there
2: lab 7
</pre>

This isn't all that exciting yet, but we will build on it to do more
interesting things!

<p>Remember to decompose your code into other functions as appropriate.
For example, you probably want to make a separate function to print the
document at the end.

<h2>Step 2: Commands and Printing</h2>

In addition to simply entering lines of text to append to the current
document, we are going to allow the user to enter
various <em>commands</em>.  Some commands have an <em>argument</em>
and some don't.

<ul>
  <li>
    First, you should split the user's input into two parts: the first
    word (up to the first space character) and everything else (the
    argument).  (<em>Hint:</em> try using <code>.split(' ', 1)</code>
    on the user input.  What does it do?)
  </li>

  <li>
    If the user enters just a single word with nothing after it, you
    should treat the argument as if it were the empty string.  Save
    the argument in a variable for later; you won't use it in this
    step but you will need it soon.
  </li>

  <li>
    Now check if the command is one you recognize.  For now, we are
    just going to add the <code>print</code> command: when the user
    types <code>print</code>, print out the current document with its
    lines prefixed by their index, just as before.
  </li>

  <li>
    Otherwise, append the user's original, un-split input to the
    current document, just like before.
  </li>
</ul>

Since the user can now choose to <code>print</code> whenever they
want, you can remove the code that prints the document after
they <code>quit</code>.

Your editor now might look like this:

<pre>
> Hello there
> print
0: Hello there
> How are you
> doing today
> print
0: Hello there
1: How are you
2: doing today
> quit
</pre>

<h2>Step 3: Tracking the current line</h2>

Modify your editor so that it keeps track of the index of
the <em>current line</em>.

<ul>
  <li>The current line should start out at 0.</li>
  <li>Every time a new line is appended to the end of the document,
    the current line becomes the index of the newly appended
    line.</li>
  <li>You should change the output of the <code>print</code> command
    so that it highlights the current line somehow (for example, with
    an asterisk, as shown in the example below).</li>
  <li>Finally, add a <code>line</code> command which expects an index
    as an argument, and sets the current line to the given index; that
    is, it lets the user "jump" to a different line number.  Be sure
    that your command prints an appropriate message instead of
    crashing if the argument to <code>line</code> is not a number or
    is too small or too big to be a valid index.</li>
</ul>

For example, here's how a sample interaction with your editor might look
after you finish implementing this step:

<pre>
> Hello there
> print
*0: Hello there
> How are you?
> print
 0: Hello there
*1: How are you?
> line zero
zero is not a valid integer.
> line 5
5 is not a valid line number.
> line 0
> print
*0: Hello there
 1: How are you?
> I'm fine thanks
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: How are you?
*2: I'm fine thanks
> quit
</pre>

<h2>Step 4: Files</h2>

An editor isn't much good without being able to open and save files!
In this step, you should add two commands <code>open</code>
and <code>save</code> that let the user load a text document from a
file and save the current document to a file, respectively.

<ul>
  <li>The <code>open</code> command takes the name of a file as an
    argument.  I have provided the <code>open_file</code> function below
    which you can copy into your code; just call this function when
    the user types the <code>open</code> command. (You don't need to
    understand how this function works!)  You should also reset the
    current line to zero.

    <pre>
# Open the file with the given name and return its contents as a list
# of strings, one per line; OR print a warning and return the empty
# list if there is an error opening the file (e.g. if the file does
# not exist).
def open_file(filename: str) -> List[str]:
    try:
        print("Opening " + filename + "...")
        f = open(filename, 'r')
        lines = [l.rstrip() for l in f.readlines()]
        f.close()
        return lines
    except:
        print("Warning, file " + filename + " does not exist, loaded empty document.")
        return []
    </pre>
  </li>

  <li>Likewise, the <code>save</code> command takes a filename as an
    argument; again, just copy the below <code>save_file</code>
    function and call it.  Note that the function expects
    a <code>str</code>, not a <code>List[str]</code>: before calling
    the function you will have to turn the document from a list of
    strings, each representing one line, into a single giant string
    representing the entire document. (<em>Hint</em>:
    use <code>join</code>.)

    <pre>
# Write the given string to the file with the given name.
def save_file(filename: str, contents: str):
    try:
        print("Saving as " + filename + "...")
        f = open(filename, 'w')
        f.write(contents)
        f.close()
    except:
        print("Something went wrong saving " + filename + "!")
    </pre>
</ul>

Below are two example sessions of interacting with your editor after
implementing these commands.  In the first session, the user enters a
few lines and then saves them to a file.  In the second session, the
user enters a line before loading the previously saved file (notice
how it completely overwrites the previous document).

<pre>
> Hello there
> I am going to save this
> to a file
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
*2: to a file
> save file.txt
Saving as file.txt...
> quit


> Hello
> print
*0: Hello
> open file.txt
Opening file.txt...
> print
*0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
> quit
</pre>

<h2>Step 5: Editing!</h2>

Now we can finally get to some more serious editing!  You should add
the following commands to your editor:

<ul>
  <li><code>append</code>: this command simply appends whatever
    follows it as a new line at the end of the current document.  This
    is necessary to allow appending lines that would otherwise look
    like they start with a command.  Be sure that the current line is
    updated to the newly appended line.

    <pre>
> How do I
> print this?
*0: How do I
> append print this?
> print
 0: How do I
*1: print this?
    </pre>
  </li>

  <li><code>insert</code>: this command inserts its argument as a new
    line just before the current line.  The index of the current line
    should remain the same (so the newly inserted line becomes the
    current line).

    <pre>
> open file.txt
Opening file.txt...
> print
*0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
> insert This is a new first line
> print
*0: This is a new first line
 1: Hello there
 2: I am going to save this
 3: to a file
> line 2
> print
 0: This is a new first line
 1: Hello there
*2: I am going to save this
 3: to a file
> insert This comes after 'Hello there' and before 'I am going to save this'
> print
 0: This is a new first line
 1: Hello there
*2: This comes after 'Hello there' and before 'I am going to save this'
 3: I am going to save this
 4: to a file
    </pre>
  </li>

  <li><code>delete</code>: delete the current line. The index of the
    current line remains the same.  Make sure to check that the
    current line is a valid index that can be deleted.

    <pre>
> delete
Can't delete past end of document.
> open file.txt
Opening file.txt...
> print
*0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
> line 1
> delete
> print
 0: Hello there
*1: to a file
    </pre>
  </li>

  <li><code>replace</code>: replace the current line.

    <pre>
> replace Nope
Can't replace past end of document.
> open file.txt
Opening file.txt...
> print
*0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
> line 1
> replace I am going to write this
> print
 0: Hello there
*1: I am going to write this
 2: to a file
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 6: Finding</h2>

Finally, let's provide a way for the user to quickly search through a
document.

<ul>
  <li>Add a <code>find</code> command which searches for its argument
    in the document, starting from the beginning of the document.  It
    should either set the current line to the first line containing
    the search term, or set the current line to the first
    index <em>after</em> the end of the document if the search term is
    not found.

    <pre>
> open file.txt
Opening file.txt...
> line 2
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
*2: to a file
> find pizza
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
> find am
> print
 0: Hello there
*1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
    </pre>
  </li>

  <li>Add a <code>next</code> command, which finds the next occurrence
    of the previous search term starting with the line after the
    current line.  That is, by calling <code>find</code> and then
    repeatedly calling <code>next</code>, the user can step through
    occurrences of the search term one by one.

    <pre>
> open file.txt
Opening file.txt...
> I am going to search
> for the word am
> This line doesn't have it
> But I am sure this one does
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
 3: I am going to search
 4: for the word am
 5: This line doesn't have it
*6: But I am sure this one does
> find am
> print
 0: Hello there
*1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
 3: I am going to search
 4: for the word am
 5: This line doesn't have it
 6: But I am sure this one does
> next 
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
*3: I am going to search
 4: for the word am
 5: This line doesn't have it
 6: But I am sure this one does
> next
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
 3: I am going to search
*4: for the word am
 5: This line doesn't have it
 6: But I am sure this one does
> next
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
 3: I am going to search
 4: for the word am
 5: This line doesn't have it
*6: But I am sure this one does
> next
> print
 0: Hello there
 1: I am going to save this
 2: to a file
 3: I am going to search
 4: for the word am
 5: This line doesn't have it
 6: But I am sure this one does
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Just for fun</h2>

Save a copy of your lab in another file, just in case.  Then, try
opening <code>line_editor.py</code> itself in your editor, and making
a few changes.  Rejoice that we now have screens and two-dimensional
editor interfaces so you normally don't have to put up with this.
