<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- As we study computation and life, we can ask "How did life evolve from single-celled organisms -->
<!-- into the diversity of life we -->
<!-- see today?"  The answer lies in a process called -->
<!--  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation">mutation</a>. -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- Separate from the DNA-RNA-Protein process are two separate processes for cell duplication called -->
<!-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis">mitosis</a> and -->
<!-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis">meiosis</a>.  Both processes involve -->
<!-- a cell replicating its DNA, and it is within this replication that mutations can occur. -->
<!-- Perhaps there was a copying mistake, or a random x-ray damaged part of the DNA; -->
<!-- in any case, the DNA code we begin with can undergo small alterations.  Each mutation -->
<!-- during this replication process could possibly have a large impact of the earlier transcription -->
<!-- and translation process, such that we could have a new stop codon within a gene, -->
<!-- or we could place a different amino acid into our protein chain.  While some changes may be -->
<!-- very harmful and lead to genetic diseases, others could provide an unexpected benefit and -->
<!-- new functionality. These underlying mutations -->
<!-- introduce variety into the gene pool for a population, and allow natural selection -->
<!-- and evolution to occur. -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- While the language of DNA was not understood until 1953 by -->
<!-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_and_Crick">James Watson and Francis Crick</a> -->
<!-- with the help of data from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin">Rosalind -->
<!-- Franklin</a>, similar properties of mutation were noticed nearly 100 years earlier by -->
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll">Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll)
</a>, who is most famous for his novel "Alice in Wonderland",
introduced a puzzle called Doublets in an article for
<i>Vanity Fair</i>.  The puzzle explores the effects of mutation on
English words.  His rules description is as follows:
<blockquote>
The rules of the Puzzle are simple enough. Two words are proposed, of the same length;
and the Puzzle consists in linking these together by interposing other words,
each of which shall differ from the next word in one letter only. That is to say,
one letter may be changed in one of the given words, then one letter in the word so
obtained, and so on, till we arrive at the other given word. The letters must not be
interchanged among themselves, but each must keep to its own place. As an example,
the word 'head' may be changed into 'tail' by interposing the words
'heal, teal, tell, tall'. I call the given words 'a Doublet', the interposed words
'Links', and the entire series 'a Chain', of which I here append an example:
<p>
<pre>
H E A D
h e a l
t e a l
t e l l
t a l l
T A I L
</pre>
<p>
It is, perhaps, needless to state that it is de rigueur that the links should be
English words, such as might be used in good society.
</blockquote>

<!-- (More details on the connection between Lewis Carroll and genetics can be found in an article by -->
<!-- David B. Searls entitled <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10665270152530881"> -->
<!-- From <i>Jabberwocky</i> to Genome: Lewis Carroll and Computational Biology</a>). -->
<p>
Our task for this lab is to create a Python program that lets a user play the Doublets game
and enforces all the rules given above by Lewis Carroll.

<!-- <h3>Step 1 - Analyze the Problem, Create Specifications</h3> -->

<!-- We will tackle this puzzle using the software engineering phases. -->
<!-- First, analyze the problem to see what steps we can take to model this inside a computer. -->
<!-- Try to answer the following questions: -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li>What input do we need from the user? Output for the user? -->
<!-- 	<li>What are all the possible ways that the user could enter incorrect data? -->
<!-- 	<li>Is there any data input from the user we need to standardize? -->
<!-- 	<li>How can we keep track of the solution path? -->
<!-- </ul> -->
<!-- <p> -->

<!-- Write your answers in <code>Lab Evaluation</code>. -->

<h3>Step 1 - Develop Pseudocode</h3>
Begin by developing an algorithmic solution using
<i>pseudocode</i>.  This should correspond to the structure of a
Python program, but is written in English instead of Python.
</p>

<p>For example, pseudocode for a guessing-game could look like this:
<p>
<pre>
Generate a number for the human to guess
As long as the human has not guessed the number
    Request a guess from the human
    If it's too high or too low, say so
Congratulate the human on their insight
</pre>

<p>
The point is that this is <i>structured</i> like Python, using
indentation and hinting at loops and conditionals.  But the individual
pieces are just English descriptions, which you will later translate into
precise Python code.

<p>

To demonstrate the eventual behavior of the program, here is a
sample run of the Doublets game.
<p>
<pre>
What is the starting word? <span>CAT</span>
What is the ending word? <span>DOG</span>
Start   = CAT
Current = CAT
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>3</span>
What is your new character? <span>B</span>
Current = CAB
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>2</span>
What is your new character? <span>O</span>
Current = COB
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>3</span>
What is your new character? <span>G</span>
Current = COG
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>1</span>
What is your new character? <span>D</span>
Solution path found in 4 steps.
CAT -> CAB -> COB -> COG -> DOG
</pre>
<p>
A second run of the program is shown below, where the user made many mistakes.
<p>
<pre>
What is the starting word? <span>log</span>
What is the ending word? <span>worm</span>
The lengths are not equal. Please try again.
What is the ending word? <span>sfu</span>
sfu is not a word. Please try again.
What is the ending word? <span>bug</span>
Start   = LOG
Current = LOG
End     = BUG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>0</span>
0 is out of range. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>4</span>
4 is out of range. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>1</span>
What is your new character? <span>4</span>
4og is not a valid word
Current = LOG
End     = BUG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>1</span>
What is your new character? <span>b</span>
Current = BOG
End     = BUG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>x</span>
x is not a number. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>2</span>
What is your new character? <span>uu</span>
uu is more than one character. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) <span>2</span>
What is your new character? <span>u</span>
Solution path found in 2 steps.
LOG -> BOG -> BUG
</pre>
<p>
Add the pseudocode to your <code>Lab Evaluation</code>.
<p>

<h3>Step 2 - Implement Incrementally</h3>
Download the text file <code><a href="../data/english2.txt">english2.txt</a></code>
and the python module <code>
<a href="../data/dictionary.py">dictionary.py</a></code> files, and
make sure they are in the same folder where you will put your lab.
You <b>do not need to copy and paste</b> anything!  At the top of your
Python program, you should put

<pre>import dictionary</pre>

which will allow you to use the functions in <code>dictionary.py</code>.

The dictionary module contains a function
<code>valid_word(word, file)</code>, which will
return <code>True</code> if the word is found in the file and <code>False</code>
otherwise.  You can call the function by writing something like

<pre>dictionary.valid_word(some_word, 'english2.txt')</pre>

<p>
Now take your pseduocode description and begin to implement your
program in Python.  Your program should be
named <code>doublets.py</code>.  Write your code in small sections and
test incrementally.

Remember that your program should be structured <b>entirely using
    functions</b>.  Your program should look something like this:
<pre>
  # Input: ...
  # Output: ...
  # Description
  def fun1(x,y,z):
    ...

  ... More functions here with appropriate comments ...

  def main():
    ...

  main()
</pre>

I recommend starting by getting things to work first without using
functions, and then incrementally abstracting parts of your program
into functions until the whole program is appropriately decomposed.

<h3>Step 3 - Test, Debug and Maintain</h3>
With incremental implementation, Steps 3 and 4 should go hand in hand.  Never write more than
5-10 lines of code before testing your changes.  First make your program work with perfect
input, and then expand it to work with erroneous user input.
<p>
Once your program is working, try out some of the transformations below
<ul>
<li>FIRE -- HEAT
<li>SLEEP -- DREAM
<li>APE -- MAN
<li>WHITE -- BLACK
</ul>

<h3>Future Thoughts</h3>
Your <code>doublets.py</code> program lets the user chose what character to change at each step,
and then verifies that each new word is a valid word.  Can you think of a way to always find the
minimum number of steps to transform one word to another?  How will you know if a path
between two words can be found? Include your answers to these questions
in the Evaluation Document.

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Make sure you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
You must hand in:
<ul>
	<li>Evaluation Document (containing pseudocode, and answers to
	"Future thoughts" questions)

 	<li><code>english2.txt</code>
</ul>
(Yes, please turn in <code>dictionary.py</code>
and <code>english2.txt</code> even though you did not create them---it makes
the grading process much easier!)
