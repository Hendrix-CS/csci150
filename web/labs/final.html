<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> Final Project</h1>
<hr>

Instead of a final exam, you will complete a final project which will
count for 20% of your final grade in the course.

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Project design due (2%): <b>Tuesday, April 25 @ 4pm</b></li>
<li>Project due (15%): <b>Friday, May 5 @ 2pm</b></li>
<li>Presentations (3%): <b>Friday, May 5, 2-5pm</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>Unlike the other projects, you may work with one partner for the final
project. You can also work individually if you wish.</p>

<p>You have wide latitude in choosing what to do for your final
  project. The only requirements are that it should be sufficiently
  complex and should somehow go beyond what we have done in class or
  lab.  Your project idea <b>must</b> be approved by your lecture
  instructor (who is also happy to help you brainstorm)
  via email or conversation prior to the April 25 design
  submission.  <b>Get started early!</b>  Waiting until just before
  the April 25 deadline to start thinking about your final project
  will be too late.</p>

<p>Projects <b>must</b> make use of Python <code>class</code>es to
encapsulate and structure data.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

By Tuesday, April 25, you must turn in a design document describing
your project and planning details of how you will implement
it.  <b>Warning</b>: you should start thinking about, designing, and even
implementing your project long before this!

Your design must include:
<ul>
  <li>A description of the classes you will use to decompose the
    information in your project, with a list of the variables and
    methods in each class.</li>
  <li>A description the main algorithm which will control the
    project.</li>
  <li>A list of functions you will use to decompose the project, with
    the inputs, output, and description for each.</li>
  <li>A timeline of steps you will take to complete your project with
    deadlines for each step. Plan not just what you must do but the
    ordering of steps that will allow you to complete by the final
    deadline.</li>
  <li>A description of the way(s) in which your project goes beyond
    what we have done in class and labs.</li>
</ul>

You should be as detailed as possible for full credit in your
description. Time spent on the design will pay off immensely as you
implement your project.

<h2>Presentation</h2>

Everyone in the class will present their projects from 2-5pm on
Friday, May 5. Your presentation, using PowerPoint, Prezi, or some
other appropriate presentation software, will be <b>at most 6 minutes
long</b>. (I am serious about this; presentations that are too long
will lose points.  Practice beforehand to make sure you have a good
sense for how much time you have.  Six minutes is not very long at
all.)

<p>Your presentation should include <b>three slides</b> and a <b>quick
  demo of your project</b>.  The three slides should answer three
  questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the overall idea of your project?</li>
<li>What is interesting/unique about your project?</li>
<li>What was one of the biggest challenges you faced and how did you
  overcome it?</li>
</ul>

<p>You might plan to spend, for example, 30 seconds on each slide and
  then use the remaining time doing the demo.</p>

<p><b>Do not</b> just get up in front of the class and show us your code
(unless there is something very specific you want to show us about a
particular challenge you overcame)!  This is super boring and wastes a
lot of time.</p>

<p>If you worked on the project with a partner, <b>both partners</b> must
be involved in giving the presentation.  For example, you might have
one partner present the slides and the other present the project demo
(but feel free to do whatever makes sense).</p>

<h2>What to turn in</h2>

On Moodle, you should turn in

<ul>
  <li>Your presentation slides (if your slides are on Prezi or Google
    Slides or some other cloud-based system, just submit the URL).</li>
  <li>A document explaining how to run your project and any other
    special notes to the grader.</li>
  <li><b>All</b> the Python source files, data files, etc. necessary
  to run your project.</li>
</ul>
