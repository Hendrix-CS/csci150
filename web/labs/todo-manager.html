<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> Lab 7: Todo Manager</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

In this lab, you will practice using lists and strings in Python by
implementing a very simple todo manager, which helps you keep track of
a list of things to do (or a list of anything at all).

Here's an example of what your program might look like by the end of
the lab:

<pre>

<h2>Step 1: Bits and Pieces</h2>

Create a new Python file called <code>todo_manager.py</code>, and put
your name, date, copyright notice, <em>etc.</em> at the top. Also,
don't forget to include the line
<pre>
from typing import *
</pre>
at the top of your file, which you will need in order to write types
involving lists.

Start by defining the following functions:

<ul>
  <li><code>print_numbered_list(items: List[str])</code>

    <p>This function should take a list of strings as input and print them
  out, one per line, with numbers in front of them.  For example, if
  given the list <code>['hat', 'socks', 'shoes']</code> as input, it
  should print out

    <pre>
0) hat
1) socks
2) shoes
    </pre>

    <b>Be sure to test your function</b> by right-clicking and choosing "Run File in Console"
    and then trying your function with different inputs.  For example,
    if you type

    <pre>
print_numbered_items(['hat', 'socks', 'shoes'])
    </pre>

    at the prompt, you should see the output shown above.
  </li>

  <li><p><code>def get_choice(prompt: str, choices: List[str]) -> int:</code>

      <p>This function takes as input a prompt string and a list of
    choices, and returns an <code>int</code> corresponding to the
    user's choice.  It should carry out the following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Print out a numbered list of the choices
        (using <code>print_numbered_list</code>).</li>
      <li>Prompt the user for input (using the provided <code>prompt</code>).</li>
      <li>Check to make sure the user's input is a number, and if so,
        that it corresponds to one of the choices.</li>
      <li>If the user's input is invalid, print an appropriate error
        message and simply return <code>-1</code>.  Don't use a loop
        to re-prompt the user.  This will allow the user to "cancel"
        by entering an invalid input.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the user entered a valid choice, return the
        number they chose.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Again, you should be sure to load your file into the console and
    test it</b>.  For example, you might see something like this:
    <pre>
>>> get_choice("Whaddaya want? ", ['hat', 'socks', 'shoes'])
0) hat
1) socks
2) shoes
Whaddaya want? shirt
Sorry, shirt is not a number.
-1

>>> get_choice("Whaddaya want? ", ['hat', 'socks', 'shoes'])
0) hat
1) socks
2) shoes
Whaddaya want? 5
Sorry, 5 is not a valid choice.
-1

>>> get_choice("Whaddaya want? ", ['hat', 'socks', 'shoes'])
0) hat
1) socks
2) shoes
Whaddaya want? 2
2
    </pre>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Loading and Saving</h2>

A todo list manager isn't much good without being able to load and
save lists of todos!  You wouldn't want to have to type in all your
todos every time you run the program.

<p>I have provided functions you can use to open and save text files.
Later in the semester we will learn more about how they work.  For
now, you can just copy and paste these functions into your program.

<pre>
# Open the file with the given name and return its contents as a list
# of strings, one per line; OR print a warning and return the empty
# list if there is an error opening the file (e.g. if the file does
# not exist).
def open_file(filename: str) -> List[str]:
    try:
        f = open(filename, 'r')
        lines = [l.rstrip() for l in f.readlines()]
        f.close()
        return lines
    except:
        print("Warning, file " + filename + " does not exist.")
        return []

# Write the given string to the file with the given name.
def save_file(filename: str, contents: str):
    try:
        f = open(filename, 'w')
        f.write(contents)
        f.close()
    except:
        print("Something went wrong saving " + filename + "!")
</pre>

Now define a function <code>main()</code> which does the following:
<ul>
  <li>Prompt the user for the name of the file containing their todo list.</li>
  <li>Open the file (using the <code>open_file</code> function) and
    save the contents into a list variable.</li>
  <li>Print out the todo list
    using <code>print_numbered_list</code>.</li>
  <li>Add a fake todo item to the end of the list (this part is just
    temporary, to make sure everything else is working; you will remove
    it in the next step.</li>
  <li>Save the new, extended list back to the file using
    the <code>save_file</code> function.   Note
    that <code>save_file</code> expects a string, not a list of strings,
    so you will have to turn the list of todos into a single string
    using something like <code>'\n'.join(todos)</code>, which puts the
    list of todos together with a newline character in between each one.</li>
</ul>

Again, you should be sure to test your <code>main()</code>
function. (You can use whatever file name you want for your todo list;
if it doesn't already exist, it will be created by <code>save_file</code>.)
You should be able to tell if the loading and saving is working since
after running <code>main()</code> your todo file should have one more line
at the end.

Menu choices in a loop. quit.

<h2>Step 3: Menu</h2>

Now modify your <code>main()</code> function so it lets the user
repeatedly choose options from a menu. In particular:
<ul>
  <li>Create a list of strings representing the different menu choices
    that will be available to the user: there should be an option to add
    a todo, remove a todo, modify a todo, search for a todo, or quit.</li>
  <li>Make a loop that keeps printing the list of todos and then
    prompting the user for their choice from the menu (using
    the <code>get_choice</code> function you wrote in Step 1 and the
    list of menu choices) until they choose to quit.  At this point
    nothing will actually happen when they choose things from the
    menu; you will fix that in the next step.
</ul>

You should also get rid of the code that adds a fake todo item to the
end of the list.

<h2>Step 4: Operations</h2>

Now it's time to actually implement the operations!  Below are
descriptions of what the different menu choices should do.  You can
also look at the example program output at the top of this lab for
inspiration.

<b>Be sure to test that each operation works before moving on to the
next!</b>

<h3>add</h3>

If the user chooses to add a new todo item, you should prompt them for
a new todo and add it to the end of the list.

<h3>remove</h3>

If the user chooses to remove a todo item, you should
use <code>get_choice</code> to ask for the index of the item they
would like to remove.  If <code>get_choice</code>
returns <code>-1</code>, do nothing.  Otherwise, you can use
the <code>pop</code> list function to remove the item at a particular
index, for example, if your list of todos is called <code>todos</code>
and the user's choice is stored in a variable
called <code>choice</code>, you could
write <code>todos.pop(choice)</code>.

<h3>replace</h3>

This should work similarly to remove: ask the user which item they
would like to replace; if they make a valid choice, prompt them for a
new todo item, and replace the item at the index they chose.

<h3>search</h3>

You should first write a function
<pre>
def find_all(term: str, items: List[str]) -> List[str]:
</pre>
which takes a search term and a list of items, and returns the list of
only those items from the list which contain the search term.  You can
check whether one string contains another string using
the <code>in</code> operator: for example, <code>"th" in
  "python"</code> will return <code>True</code>, but <code>"z" in
  "python"</code> is <code>False</code>.

Test your function in the console: for example, you should get
<pre>
>>> find_all("ab", ["baby", "dog", "cat", "absolute", "table", "python"])
["baby", "absolute", "table"]
</pre>

Now implement the search menu choice: prompt the user what they want
to search for, use <code>find_all</code> to get the todos that match
their search term, and display them to the user
using <code>print_numbered_list</code>.

<p>At this point you should be able to reproduce something similar to
  the example program run shown at the beginning of the lab!  Note,
  however, that your output does not need to be identical to the
  example shown.  Feel free to use your creativity to make it look
  nice or add your own extra features.
