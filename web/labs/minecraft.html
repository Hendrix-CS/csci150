<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> Lab 1: Minecraft</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab, you will get a first taste of programming by directing a
character's actions in the virtual world Minecraft.

<h2>Materials</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://studio.code.org/join/XGHRWB">Minecraft at Code.org</a>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Follow the link above and sign up for an account at Code.org. <b>Be
sure to use your Hendrix email address</b>, since this is the only way
we will be able to assign you a grade for this lab.  If working with a
partner, put <b>both partners' names in the name field</b>.
<p>
Work through the stages of the Minecraft programming section. First,
just try to solve each puzzle by piecing together a valid
solution. Then, focus on being efficient in your code, as each level
has a minimum number of blocks that can be used to develop a solution.
<p>
Note that the final "open-ended" level is just for fun and does not
need to be completed in order to complete the lab.

<h2>Submission</h2>

  one) using the minimum number of blocks.
