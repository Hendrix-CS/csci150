<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 2<br>Kepler and Newton</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab you will write a program to help the user explore Kepler's Third Law of
Planetary motion, using both Kepler's original equation and Newton's reformulation. This
will give you practice writing, testing and maintaining simple Python programs that
follow the Python style guide.

<h2>Description</h2>
A first step in searching for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is to find
other planets that may harbor life.  While much time is being spent to analyze the closest
possibility of Mars, researchers have made progress in recent years toward finding
planets outside our solar system orbiting other stars. The first few of these
<a href="http://exoplanet.eu/">extrasolar planets</a> found were as large or larger than
Jupiter with wildly eccentric orbits, however as our methods of detection become more
precise we are starting to find Earth-sized planets that may provide a good foundation for life.
In this lab we'll discuss planetary motion in general and apply our computing skills to
study various exoplanets.
<p>
<h3>Kepler</h3>
<img class="entryimageleft" src="../images/kepler_pic.jpg">
One astronomer who made a major advance in the understanding of our solar system and
astrophysics in general was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>.
In fact, NASA launched a satellite to search for habitable planets in 2009, and has
named this <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">mission</a> after Kepler.
In the early 1600s he published his now-famous three laws of planetary motion.
These laws, based on years of stellar and planetary observation by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>,
finally fixed any lingering anomalies in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_system">Copernican theory</a>
that the Earth and other planets
revolved around the Sun. The first law states that the planets orbited the Sun in ellipses with
the Sun at one foci.  The second law states that planets would travel faster the closer they are
to the sun and slower when farther away.
<p>
The third law describes the relationship Kepler observed between a planet's distance from the
sun and the time it takes to make one complete orbit around the sun.
Kepler stated that the square of a planet's orbital period in years was equal to that planet's
distance from the sun in Astronomical Units (AU) cubed, where and AU is the
average distance of the Earth to
the Sun (149 million kilometers).
<p>

<b>Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion</b><p>
<img src="../images/kepler.jpg">
</div>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
Write a program called <code>orbit_kepler.py</code> for Kepler's Third Law
of planetary motion.
This program will ask the user for the name of the planet
and its orbital period in years.
It should then calculate the average distance from the sun in astronomical units (AU)
of this planet and display the result to the user.  Make sure to follow
the <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a> when writing your program.
<p>
Test your code with the following values for planets orbiting the Sun:
<p>
<div align="center">
<b>Table 1: Planets and their Orbital Period</b><p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th>Planet</th><th>Period</th><th>AU from Sun</th></tr>
<tr><td>Earth</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Saturn</td><td>29.660974748248961</td><td>9.58201720</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mercury</td><td>0.24084173359179098</td><td>0.38709821</td></tr>
</td></table>
</div>
<p>
<h3>Newton</h3>
<img class="entryimageleft" src="../images/newton_pic.jpg">
In 1687, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a> followed
up on the laws of Kepler to publish his
<i>Principia Mathematica</i>. In this work, he explained that it was the
universal force of gravity which tied together the motion of the planets and the motion
of objects here on Earth.  Kepler's third law was found to be a special case of a more general
law about the gravitational attraction between two objects in space, M1 and M2. Now, instead
of Kepler's law being tied to the Earth and the Sun, we can now calculate the orbital
period of any planet around any star as long as we know both their masses and the
average distance of the star from the planet.
<p>
<div align="center">
<b>Newton's Revised Law of Planetary Motion</b><p>
<img src="../images/newton.jpg">
</div>
<p>
The big G in Newton's equation is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational Constant</a>
from physics, and is in terms of meters cubed over kilograms times seconds squared.
<div align="center">
<img src="../images/grav_constant.jpg">
</div>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
Revise your program <code>orbit_kepler.py</code> into <code>orbit_newton.py</code>
to use Newton's reformulation of Kepler's Third Law.  The user will be asked to enter the
name of the planet, the orbital period of the planet in days, the mass of the star in kilograms,
and the mass of the planet in kilograms. Your formula requires the period in <b>seconds</b>, you will
need to convert your input. Calculate the distance of the star from the planet next,
and output the result to the user. Since Newton's law uses <b>meters</b> instead of
AU, you will have to convert the output into the appropriate value, using the
definition of 1 AU as 149 million kilometers.
<p>
Evaluate <code>orbit_newton.py</code> using the following data, based on the best
estimates we have about recently
discovered exoplanets that may fall into the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone">Habitable Zone</a> for life.  Report your
results for the orbital period of these planets in the <code>Lab Evaluation</code>
described below.

<i>Hint: your answer for Gliese 667 C c should be close to 0.1.  If
  you are getting an answer in the billions, or billionths, or
  anything like that, your program is wrong.</i>

<!--
Answers:
Gliese 667 C c = 0.1251 AU

<h3>Step 3</h3>
Your programs were dependent on the value used in Python for <code>math.pi</code>,
namely 3.1415926535897931. This is only an estimate of Pi; others have calculated
<a href="http://www.eveandersson.com/pi/digits/1000000">
1,000,000 digits</a> of Pi, but this is still only an estimate of this irrational number.
Test out the sensitivity of your calculations above to different values of Pi, using 3.14 and
3.14159, and record your results in <code>Lab Evaluation</code>. <b>Be sure to return your
code to use the original <code>math.pi</code> before you turn in your code</b>.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
Answer the following questions in a file called <code>Lab Evaluation</code>:
<ol>
	<li>How much of your code were you able to reuse from <code>orbit_kepler.py</code>
	when writing <code>orbit_newton.py</code>?
	<li>What are the AUs for the above exoplanets?
	<li>Which do you think had a larger influence on the final calculation of the AU
	in <code>orbit_newton.py</code>, the Mass of the planet or period of the planet?  Why?
	<li>What was the effect of changing the value used for Pi in <code>orbit_newton.py</code>?
	<li>What other sources for numerical error (like that from estimating Pi)
	do you see in the code you wrote?
</ol>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
You will be handing in the three files you wrote today and the lab evaluation document.
<ul>
 	<li>orbit_kepler.py
	<li>orbit_newton.py
	<li>Lab Evaluation
</ul>
Turn in the files
electronically via <b>TBD</b>.
<p>
Make sure you run <code>orbit_kepler.py</code> and <code>orbit_newton.py</code>
through the <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html">Python
style guide</a> checking program before you turn in your work.  If you worked with a
partner, you both must hand in the files you wrote, with both of your names in the header
at the top of the file.
