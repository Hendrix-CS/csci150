<h1>CSCI 150 Lab 2: Kepler and Newton</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview and Purpose</h2>

<p class="lead">In this lab you will write a program to help the user
compute the distance of a planet from its sun, using equations
developed by Johannes Kepler and Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>The purposes of this lab are:
<ul>
  <li>To practice using Python's facilities for input and output</li>
  <li>To use Python to perform mathematical calculations</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3</li>
  <li>Lab Partner</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/math.html">Math module</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- <h2>Description</h2> -->
<!-- A first step in searching for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is to find -->
<!-- other planets that may harbor life.  While much time is being spent to analyze the closest -->
<!-- possibility of Mars, researchers have made progress in recent years toward finding -->
<!-- planets outside our solar system orbiting other stars. The first few of these -->
<!-- <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/">extrasolar planets</a> found were as large or larger than -->
<!-- Jupiter with wildly eccentric orbits, however as our methods of detection become more -->
<!-- precise we are starting to find Earth-sized planets that may provide a good foundation for life. -->
<!-- In this lab we'll discuss planetary motion in general and apply our computing skills to -->
<!-- study various exoplanets. -->
<p>
  <h3>Step 0: Getting started</h3>

  Open PyCharm and create a new project (by going to the <kbd>File</kbd> menu
  and selecting <kbd>New Project</kbd>).  Name it something like <code>Lab 01 -
  Kepler and Newton</code>.  Accept the other defaults and click <kbd>Create</kbd>.

<p>
  At this point you will have a new, empty project.  Each project can
  contain multiple Python files.  To create a new Python file, you can
  either choose <kbd>New...</kbd> under the <kbd>File</kbd> menu, or right click on the
  project folder and select <kbd>New...</kbd>.  Make sure you select <kbd>New
  Python File</kbd>.  Then you can type in a name for the file.  Note that
  you should not include <code>.py</code> on the end of the name;
  PyCharm will add <code>.py</code> for you.

<h3>Kepler</h3>
<img src="../images/kepler_pic.jpg" class="rounded float-left mr-3"
     alt="A picture of Johannes Kepler">
One astronomer who made a major advance in the understanding of our solar system and
astrophysics in general was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>.
In fact, NASA launched a satellite to search for habitable planets in 2009, and has
named this <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">mission</a> after Kepler.
In the early 1600s he published his now-famous three laws of planetary motion.
These laws, based on years of stellar and planetary observation by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>,
finally fixed any lingering anomalies in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_system">Copernican theory</a>
that the Earth and other planets
revolved around the Sun. The first law states that the planets orbited the Sun in ellipses with
the Sun at one foci.  The second law states that planets would travel faster the closer they are
to the sun and slower when farther away.
<p>
The third law describes the relationship Kepler observed between a planet's distance from the
sun and the time it takes to make one complete orbit around the sun.
Kepler stated that the square of a planet's orbital period in years was equal to that planet's
distance from the sun in Astronomical Units (AU) cubed, where and AU is the
average distance of the Earth to
the Sun (149 million kilometers).
<p>
<p>
<div align="center" class="border rounded mb-3 pt-3">
<b>Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion</b><p>
    \[ \huge{p^2 = a^3} \]
</div>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>
Create a Python program called <code>orbit_kepler.py</code> for
Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.  (Remember that you should not
type the <code>.py</code> part; PyCharm will add it for you.) This
program should:
<ul>
  <li>Ask the user for the name of the planet and its orbital period
    in years (this is \(p\) in the equation above).</li>
  <li>Calculate the average distance from the sun and display the
    result to the user in astronomical units (this is \(a\) in the
    equation above).  You will have to do a little algebra to figure
    out how to compute \(a\) if you know \(p\).</li>
</ul>
Be sure to follow
the <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html">Python
Style Guide</a> when writing your program.  You should test your code
with the following values for planets orbiting the Sun:
<p>
<div align="center">
<b>Table 1: Planets and their Orbital Period</b><p>
<table class="table"><tr><th>Planet</th><th>Period</th><th>AU from Sun</th></tr>
<tr><td>Earth</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Saturn</td><td>29.660974748248961</td><td>9.58201720</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mercury</td><td>0.24084173359179098</td><td>0.38709821</td></tr>
</td></table>
</div>
<p>
<h3>Newton</h3>
<img src="../images/newton_pic.jpg" class="rounded float-left mr-3"
     alt="A picture of Sir Isaac Newton">
In 1687, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a> followed
up on the laws of Kepler to publish his
<i>Principia Mathematica</i>. In this work, he explained that it was
the universal force of gravity which tied together the motion of the
planets and the motion of objects here on Earth.  Kepler's third law
was found to be a special case of a more general law about the
gravitational attraction between two objects in space, \(M_1\) and
\(M_2\). Now, instead of Kepler's law being tied to the Earth and the
Sun, we can now calculate the orbital period of any planet around any
star as long as we know both their masses and the average distance of
the star from the planet.
<p>

<div align="center" class="border rounded mb-3 pt-3">
<b>Newton's Revised Law of Planetary Motion</b><p>
    \[ \huge{p^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G(M_1 + M_2)} a^3} \]
</div>

<p>
Again, \(p\) is the period of the planet, measured in seconds. \(M_1\)
and \(M_2\) are the masses of the planet and its star in kilograms.
\(G\) is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational
  Constant</a>, which is approximately \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \)
  (measured in units of \(\mathrm{m}^3/(\mathrm{kg} \,
  \mathrm{s}^2)\)).  Remember that you can enter numbers in scientific
  notation using Python syntax like <code>6.67e-11</code>.  To access
\(\pi\), you can add the line
  <pre><code>import math</code></pre>
  to the top of your program, and then use <code>math.pi</code>
  anywhere in your program that you need the value of \(\pi\).

  <p class="mt-3">
  Just like before, your program will need to find \(a\), the distance
  between the planet and star.  You will need to solve the equation
  for \(a\) to figure out what Python code to write.  It's OK if you
  don't remember how to do this&mdash;just ask for help!

<h3>Step 2</h3> Make a copy of <code>orbit_kepler.py</code>
called <code>orbit_newton.py</code>.  Now
modify <code>orbit_newton.py</code> to use Newton's revised law of
planetary motion instead of Kepler's law.

<ul>
  <li>The user should be prompted to enter
    <ul>
      <li>the name of the planet,</li>
      <li>the orbital period of the planet in
        days,</li>
      <li>the mass of the star in kilograms,</li>
      <li>and the mass of the planet in kilograms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Newton's formula requires the period in <b>seconds</b>, so you
    will need to convert the user's input from days into seconds.</li>
  <li>Calculate the distance of the star from the planet using
    Newton's formula.</li>
  <li>Since Newton's law uses <b>meters</b> instead of AU, you will
    have to convert the output from meters to AU, using the
    fact that 1 AU is equal to 149 million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Evaluate <code>orbit_newton.py</code> using the following data, based
on the best estimates we have about recently discovered exoplanets
that may fall into the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone">Habitable
  Zone</a> for life.  Remember that you should be able to enter
  numbers like \(6.1659 \times 10^{29}\) into your program using the
  syntax <code>6.1659e29</code>.  Report your results for the orbital
  period of these planets in the <code>Lab Evaluation</code> described
  below.

<i>Hint: all your answers should be somewhere within the range of 0.1
  to 10 AU.  If you are getting answers in the billions, or
  billionths, or anything like that, there is a bug in your program.

<h3>Step 3</h3>
Your programs were dependent on the value used in Python for <code>math.pi</code>,
namely 3.1415926535897931. This is only an estimate of \(\pi\); others have calculated
<a href="http://www.eveandersson.com/pi/digits/1000000">
1,000,000 digits</a> of \(\pi\), but this is still only an estimate of this irrational number.
Test out the sensitivity of your calculations above to different values of \(\pi\), using <code>3.14</code> and
<code>3.14159</code>, and record your results in <code>Lab
Evaluation</code>. <b>Be sure to return your code to use the
original <code>math.pi</code> before you turn it in</b>.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
Answer the following questions in a file called <code>Lab Evaluation</code>:
<ol>
	<li>How much of your code were you able to reuse from <code>orbit_kepler.py</code>
	when writing <code>orbit_newton.py</code>?
	<li>What are the AUs for the above exoplanets?
	<li>Which do you think had a larger influence on the final
	calculation of the AU in <code>orbit_newton.py</code>, the
	mass of the planet or period of the planet?  Why?
	<li>What was the effect of changing the value used for \(\pi\)
	in <code>orbit_newton.py</code>?
	<li>What other sources for numerical error (like that from estimating Pi)
	do you see in the code you wrote?
</ol>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2> You will be handing in the two Python
programs you wrote today along with the lab evaluation document.
<ul>
 	<li><code>orbit_kepler.py</code>
	<li><code>orbit_newton.py</code>
	<li>Lab Evaluation
</ul>
Turn in the files electronically via the submission form (linked from
the course webpage).

Make sure you run <code>orbit_kepler.py</code>
and <code>orbit_newton.py</code> through
the <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/python_style_guide.html">Python
style guide</a> checking program before you turn in your work.  If you
worked with a partner, make sure you put both names at the top of all
your files, and <b>only one of you</b> should submit the lab.
