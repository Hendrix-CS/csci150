# Code of Conduct, CSCI 150 Lab Wednesday 1-4 pm

As students working in partnerships, we commit to:
* Communicating well
* Being encouraging
* Bouncing ideas off each other
* Listening carefully when others are frustrated
* Being receptive to feedback
* Respecting that other students will have different backgrounds in coding
* Giving grace to each other
* Allowing everyone to contribute
* Slowing down and explaining solutions, even if slowing down is frustrating
