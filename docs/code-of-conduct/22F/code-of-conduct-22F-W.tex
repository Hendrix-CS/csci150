\section{Respect}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Be patient. Be nice. Be chill.
  \item Don't be rude.  Use an appropriate tone and words.
  \item Don't make assumptions about your partner.
  \item If there are issues, handle them appropriately.  No
    badmouthing your partner to others.
\end{itemize}

\section{Communication}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain your actions.  Don't just erase things without
    explaining.

  \item Don't talk over your partner.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Put in effort and participate.
  \item Don't work ahead of your partner.  Make sure you and your
    partner are on the same page, spreading the workload equally.
  \item Focus on learning together and teaching each other rather than
    just finishing or getting a good grade.
\end{itemize}

\section{Openness}

\begin{itemize}
\item Listen to and respect your partner's ideas and perspective.
\item Be open to criticism.
\item It's OK to disagree.
