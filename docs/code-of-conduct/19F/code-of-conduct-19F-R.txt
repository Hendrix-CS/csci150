Respect

  Learn each others' names!

  Don't invade personal space.  No keyboard snatching. No erasing code
  without permission. No inappropriate language directed at someone else.

  Don't be an ass.

Communication

  Be mature about conflict. Explain advice or critiques in a
  respectful but direct manner, and be willing to accept constructive
  criticism.

  Listen, don't just hear. Pay attention when your partner is speaking
  and don't interrupt.

Work

  Be prepared, on time, engaged and focused.

  Have a growth mindset.

  Help each other and work together; make sure you share the work
  equally and give your partner a chance to contribute.

  Ask for help if you're struggling.

Openness

  People are different! Don't make assumptions. Value your partner's
  differences and strengths, and acknowledge your own blind spots.

  Be patient.

  Be willing to experiment and explore different ideas or solutions.

  Remember that prior knowledge does not indicate learning potential.

  Remember that you're here to learn, not show off.
