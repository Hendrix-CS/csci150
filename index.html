This class is BYOL. Bring a laptop computer to class with you every day,
unless there is a test. We have a small number of computers available for students who
are unable to do so.  We will do programming exercises every class period.

<h3>IRC</h3>

<p>
We will
use <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##csci150-hendrix">an
IRC channel</a> (<tt>##csci150-hendrix</tt> on freenode servers) as a
simple real-time discussion
forum.  <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##csci150-hendrix">Click
here to chat via your web browser</a>, or you can try installing an
IRC client such as <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">LimeChat</a>
(Mac) or <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">HexChat</a> (Windows and
Linux).  We encourage you to use the IRC channel during class and lab
as a quick way to share questions or comments (or even jokes) with
your classmates, and also as a way to ask quick questions outside of
class.  You can see
a <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/logs/csci150-hendrix.log">complete
log of the channel discussion here</a>.

<p>
<a href="https://botbot.me/irc-guide/">See here for a nice overview of
  what IRC is and how to use it.</a>  For this class there are only a
  few things you really need to know:
<ul>
  <li>Address messages to other people by putting their nick at the
    beginning of the line, followed by a colon.  In most IRC clients,
    you can type just the first few letters of their nick and then hit
    "TAB" to complete it.</li>
  <li>We prefer that you use a nick that corresponds to your real
    name, though using an anonymous nick is OK if it makes you feel
    more comfortable asking questions.</li>
  <li>Don't "flood", that is, don't paste anything into the channel
    that consists of more than about 4 lines.  If you want to share
    something longer than 4 lines, e.g. a Python program, first post
    it to a pastebin such as <a href="http://chopapp.com/#">Chop</a>,
    then share the URL in the channel.</li>
  <li>Be respectful, use common sense, and keep in mind that
    everything you say in the channel is <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/logs/csci150-hendrix.log">logged
    publically</a> and will be seen by your professors.
    Inappropriate, disruptive, or insulting behavior will result in
    you being banned from the channel, or, in extreme cases, the
    entire channel being shut down.</li>
</ul>

		<h3>Overview</h3>
Introduction to solving computational problems, including the fundamentals of computer
programming. Topics include imperative programming constructs (variables, loops,
conditionals, functions, recursion), basic object-oriented constructs (classes, objects),
and some fundamental algorithms and data structures (dictionaries, arrays, linked lists,
basic sorting). Student learn these concepts through studying the Python programming
language.
<p>
At the end of the course, you will be expected to be able to:
<ul>
<li> Read, understand and execute a computer program written in Python.
<li> Read a set of requirements for a computer program in English,
     and write a short Python program (100 lines or less) that corresponds
     to them.
<li> Test a Python program and identify and fix programming errors.
<li> Identify some errors in a Python program without testing it.
<li> Without using a computer, write a very short Python code
     fragment (10 lines or less) that correctly implements a set of
     requirements.
<li> Understand and apply variables, loops, strings, lists, conditionals, and functions.
<li> Write programs to perform mathematical calculations.
<li> Understand the concept of a module.
<li> Write a Python program that is separated into at least two modules.
<li> Understand the concepts of class and object, and distinguish between them.
<li> Write a Python program including objects of at least one student-designed class.
<li> Write and understand appropriate comments in a Python program.
<li> Understand the concept of an algorithm and compare the efficiency of
     different algorithms for a simple task.
</ul>

		<h3>Disabilities</h3>

It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with disabilities, pursuant
to federal and state law.  Students should contact Julie Brown in the Office of Academic
Success (505.2954; brownj@hendrix.edu) to begin the accommodation process.  Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should inform the instructor
at the beginning of the course.

		<h3>Academic Honor</h3>

As stated in the <a href="http://www.hendrix.edu/studentlife/handbook.aspx?id=67121">Hendrix Academic
Integrity Policy</a>, all students have agreed to adhere to the following principles:
<ul>
<li>All students have an equal right to their opinions and to receive constructive criticism.

<li>Students should positively engage the course material and encourage their classmates to do the same.

<li>No students should gain an unfair advantage or violate their peers' commitment to honest work and genuine effort. It follows that any work that a student submits for class will be that student's own work. The amount of cooperation undertaken with other students, the consistency and accuracy of work, and the test-taking procedure should adhere to those guidelines that the instructor provides.

<li>Members of the Hendrix community value and uphold academic integrity because we recognize that scholarly pursuits are aimed at increasing the shared body of knowledge and that the full disclosure of sources is the most effective way to ensure accountability to both ourselves and our colleagues.
</ul>

We will provide guidelines for the amount of cooperation allowed on each assignment as
they are posted.

		In general, you may discuss topics with other students and tutors, but <b>all code you write must be your
		own, and you must be able to explain to your instructor how it works. In this
		course, it is a violation of the honor code to look at code from other students.</b>

		<h3>Extensions</h3>
		Extensions and rescheduling for labs, projects, exams and quizzes are only given when
		circumstances beyond your control (e.g. being sick, choir or sports travel)
		prevent you from completing a project on time. You
		must notify your instructor either by
		email or phone of your circumstances well in advance of the due date.
		No extensions are given for requests made within three days of the due date.

		<a name="syllabus"><h2>Syllabus</h2></a>
		We will be covering most of the material in the textbook, approximately one new chapter
		each week.
		You should view your textbook as another perspective on the material
		presented in class and covered
		in the labs. We will also be using additional supplemental material such as
		relevant web-pages
		and background material for the lab assignments.
		Readings will be assigned before material will be covered in class.  You are expected
		to review the material and come to class prepared.

		<a name="labs"><h2>Labs</h2></a>
		Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs,
		which will comprise 25% of your final grade.  Each lab will be assigned in lab with
		time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due by Friday at 4pm.
		All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion
		of your final grade.
                <p>
                <b>Lab attendance is required.</b> Labs take place in
                the <b>Snoddy Computer Lab</b>, in the Bailey Library.
                As you go through the exterior door of the library,
                turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy
                Academic Resource Center, through this door:

                <p>
                Continue through the door at the far end of the hall
                (just visible in the picture above) into the first
                computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the
                back.
		<p>
		You will be handing in your lab work
		via <a href="http://moodle.hendrix.edu">Moodle</a>.
		Instructions to do so will be included in each lab.
		<p>
		On these labs, you may work with a partner on the lab assignments if you choose.  Their name must be
		listed on any code you hand in as joint work.

		<a name="proj"><h2>Projects</h2></a>
		You will have three projects in this course, one about every five weeks, for a total of
		35% of your final grade. These projects will cover concepts we have
		discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately one week
		after they are assigned.
		<p>
		<b>You must work individually on these projects</b>.
		You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in
		must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique,
		documentation and evaluation
		of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions
		for each project will be given when they are assigned.
