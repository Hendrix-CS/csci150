			<p>
This class is BYOL. Bring a laptop computer to class with you every day,
unless there is a test. I have a small number of computers available for students who
are unable to do so.  We will do programming exercises every class period.

		<h3>Overview</h3>
Introduction to solving computational problems, including the fundamentals of computer
programming. Topics include imperative programming constructs (variables, loops,
conditionals, functions, recursion), basic object-oriented constructs (classes, objects),
and some fundamental algorithms and data structures (dictionaries, arrays, linked lists,
basic sorting). Student learn these concepts through studying the Python programming
language.
<p>
At the end of the course, you will be expected to be able to:
<ul>
<li> Read, understand and execute a computer program written in Python.
<li> Read a set of requirements for a computer program in English,
     and write a short Python program (100 lines or less) that corresponds
     to them.
<li> Test a Python program and identify and fix programming errors.
<li> Identify some errors in a Python program without testing it.
<li> Without using a computer, write a very short Python code
     fragment (10 lines or less) that correctly implements a set of
     requirements.
<li> Understand and apply variables, loops, strings, lists, conditionals, and functions.
<li> Write programs to perform mathematical calculations.
<li> Understand the concept of a module.
<li> Write a Python program that is separated into at least two modules.
<li> Understand the concepts of class and object, and distinguish between them.
<li> Write a Python program including objects of at least one student-designed class.
<li> Write and understand appropriate comments in a Python program.
<li> Understand the concept of an algorithm and compare the efficiency of
     different algorithms for a simple task.
</ul>


		<h3>Quizzes and Participation</h3>
		Sporadically throughout the semester, there will be short quizzes covering
		material from the
		previous class.
		You are encouraged to attend class and actively participate in discussions every day
		(answering questions, asking questions,
		presenting material, etc.)
		These quizzes, participation, and in class homework
		will comprise 15% of your final grade.

		<h3>Disabilities</h3>

It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with disabilities, pursuant
to federal and state law.  Students should contact Julie Brown in the Office of Academic
Success (505.2954; brownj@hendrix.edu) to begin the accommodation process.  Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should inform the instructor
at the beginning of the course.

		<h3>Academic Honor</h3>

As stated in the <a href="http://www.hendrix.edu/studentlife/handbook.aspx?id=67121">Hendrix Academic
Integrity Policy</a>, all students have agreed to adhere to the following principles:
<ul>
<li>All students have an equal right to their opinions and to receive constructive criticism.

<li>Students should positively engage the course material and encourage their classmates to do the same.

<li>No students should gain an unfair advantage or violate their peers' commitment to honest work and genuine effort. It follows that any work that a student submits for class will be that student's own work. The amount of cooperation undertaken with other students, the consistency and accuracy of work, and the test-taking procedure should adhere to those guidelines that the instructor provides.

<li>Members of the Hendrix community value and uphold academic integrity because we recognize that scholarly pursuits are aimed at increasing the shared body of knowledge and that the full disclosure of sources is the most effective way to ensure accountability to both ourselves and our colleagues.
</ul>

I will provide guidelines for the amount of cooperation allowed on each assignment as
they are posted.

		In general, you may discuss topics with other students and tutors, but <b>all code you write must be your
		own, and you must be able to explain to me how it works. In this
		course, it is a violation of the honor code to look at code from other students.</b>

		<h3>Extensions</h3>
		Extensions and rescheduling for labs, projects, exams and quizzes are only given when
		circumstances beyond your control (e.g. being sick, choir or sports travel)
		prevent you from completing a project on time. You must notify me either by
		email or phone of your circumstances well in advance of the due date.
		No extensions are given for requests made within three days of the due date.

		<a name="syllabus"><h2>Syllabus</h2></a>
		We will be covering most of the material in the textbook, approximately one new chapter
		each week.
		You should view your textbook as another perspective on the material
		presented in class and covered
		in the labs. We will also be using additional supplemental material such as
		relevant web-pages
		and background material for the lab assignments.
		Readings will be assigned before material will be covered in class.  You are expected
		to review the material and come to class prepared.

		<a name="labs"><h2>Labs</h2></a>
		Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs,
		which will comprise 25% of your final grade.  Each lab will be assigned in lab with
		time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due by Friday at 4pm.
		All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion
		of your final grade.
                <p>
                Labs take place in the <b>Snoddy Computer Lab</b>, in
                the Bailey Library.  As you go through the exterior
                door of the library, turn immediately to your left and
                enter the Snoddy Academic Resource Center, through
                this door:
                <p>

                <p>
                Continue through the door at the far end of the hall
                (just visible in the picture above) into the first
                computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the
                back.
		<p>
		You will be handing in your lab work
		via <a href="http://moodle.hendrix.edu">Moodle</a>.
		Instructions to do so will be included in each lab.
		<p>
		On these labs, you may work with a partner on the lab assignments if you choose.  Their name must be
		listed on any code you hand in as joint work.

		<a name="proj"><h2>Projects</h2></a>
		You will have three projects in this course, one about every five weeks, for a total of
		34% of your final grade. These projects will cover concepts we have
		discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately one week
		after they are assigned.
		<p>
		<b>You must work individually on these projects</b>.
		You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in
		must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique,
		documentation and evaluation
		of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions
		for each project will be given when they are assigned.
