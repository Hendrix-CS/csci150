This class is BYOL. Bring a laptop computer to class with you every day,
unless there is a test. We have a small number of computers available for students who
are unable to do so.  We will do programming exercises every class period.


		<h3>Overview</h3>
Introduction to solving computational problems, including the fundamentals of computer
programming. Topics include imperative programming constructs (variables, loops,
conditionals, functions, recursion), basic object-oriented constructs (classes, objects),
and some fundamental algorithms and data structures (dictionaries, arrays, linked lists,
basic sorting). Student learn these concepts through studying the Python programming
language.
<p>
At the end of the course, you will be expected to be able to:
<ul>
<li> Read, understand and execute a computer program written in Python.
<li> Read a set of requirements for a computer program in English,
     and write a short Python program (100 lines or less) that corresponds
     to them.
<li> Test a Python program and identify and fix programming errors.
<li> Identify some errors in a Python program without testing it.
<li> Without using a computer, write a very short Python code
     fragment (10 lines or less) that correctly implements a set of
     requirements.
<li> Understand and apply variables, loops, strings, lists, conditionals, and functions.
<li> Write programs to perform mathematical calculations.
<li> Understand the concept of a module.
<li> Write a Python program that is separated into at least two modules.
<li> Understand the concepts of class and object, and distinguish between them.
<li> Write a Python program including objects of at least one student-designed class.
<li> Write and understand appropriate comments in a Python program.
<li> Understand the concept of an algorithm and compare the efficiency of
     different algorithms for a simple task.
</ul>

		<h3>Disabilities</h3>

It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with disabilities, pursuant
to federal and state law.  Students should contact Julie Brown in the Office of Academic
Success (505.2954; brownj@hendrix.edu) to begin the accommodation process.  Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should inform the instructor
at the beginning of the course.

		<h3>Academic Honor</h3>


Please refer to the 
<a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/ac-integrity-policy.html">CSCI Academic Integrity Policy</a>.

		<h3>Revisions</h3>
        After assignments are returned, you are welcome to revise and resubmit your work. Each submitted revision will be graded anew, the original and revised grades will be averaged to produce a new grade for that assignment. Revisions may be submitted anytime until the start of the final exam period. 

        <h3>Extensions</h3>
<b>No late work will be accepted.</b> Any work not submitted on time is a zero. However, you may submit a solution after the deadline to qualify under the revision policy. In effect, this means that late work can earn up to half credit. 

		<a name="syllabus"><h2>Syllabus</h2></a>
		We will be covering most of the material in the textbook, approximately one new chapter
		each week.
		You should view your textbook as another perspective on the material
		presented in class and covered
		in the labs. We will also be using additional supplemental material such as
		relevant web-pages
		and background material for the lab assignments.
		Readings will be assigned before material will be covered in class.  You are expected
		to review the material and come to class prepared.
		<ul>
		  <li>Chapter 1 - August 25</li>
		  <li>Chapter 2 - August 28</li>
		  <li>Chapter 3 - August 28</li>
		  <li>Chapter 4 - September 1</li>
		  <li>Chapter 5 - September 18</li>
		  <li>Chapter 6 - September 20</li>
		  <li>Chapter 7 - September 25</li>
		  <li>Chapter 8 - September 25</li>
 		  <li>Chapter 9 - September 29</li>
 		  <li>Chapter 10 - October 4</li>
		  <li>Chapter 11 - October 16</li>
		  <li>Chapter 12 - October 20</li>
		  <li>Chapter 14 - October 25</li>
		  <li>Chapter 15 - November 1</li>
		  <li>Chapter 16 - November 3</li>
		  <li>Chapter 17 - November 8</li>
		  <li>Chapter 18 - November 10</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Quizzes and Participation and Homework</h2>
Throughout the semester, there will be short quizzes and homework exercises covering material 
from the previous class. Each quiz and homework exercise will be awarded a certain number of 
points. A total of 300 points will be available over the course of the semester. These quizzes, 
participation, and homework will comprise 15% of your final grade. Earning 150 points 
suffices for full credit.		<p>

		<a name="labs"><h2>Labs</h2></a>
		Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs,
		which will comprise 25% of your final grade.  Each lab will be assigned in lab with
		time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due at the start of the next lab.
		All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion
		of your final grade.
                <p>
                <b>Lab attendance is required.</b> 
                Labs take place in
                the <b>Snoddy Computer Lab</b>, in the Bailey Library</b>.
                
                
		<p>
		You will be handing in your lab work
		via <a href="http://moodle.hendrix.edu">Moodle</a>.
		Instructions to do so will be included in each lab.
		<p>
		On these labs, you may work with a partner on the lab assignments if you choose.  Their name must be
		listed on any code you hand in as joint work.

		<a name="proj"><h2>Projects</h2></a>
		You will have three projects in this course, one about every five weeks, for a total of
		35% of your final grade. These projects will cover concepts we have
		discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately one week
		after they are assigned.
		<p>
		<b>You must work individually on these projects</b>.
		You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in
		must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique,
		documentation and evaluation
		of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions
		for each project will be given when they are assigned.
