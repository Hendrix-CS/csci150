    # a note on colors:
    # you can specify a color in two ways:
    # ** RGB (Red, Green, Blue), with intensities between 0 and 255, so that
    #       (255,255,255) is white and (0,0,0) is black
    # ** named colors: there are 600+ named colors
    #   see https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/color_list.html

    # Drawing Objects

    # pygame.draw.<object> will let us draw things!
