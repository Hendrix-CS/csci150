A computer is just a device for processing information of various kinds. But how does it do that?\n\nToday, we'll take a small look \"under the hood,\" seeing a bit (sorry!) about how it encodes information. We will only scratch the surface here -- if you go on, you'll learn more in CSCI 151 (Data Structures) and later CSCI courses.\n\nEssentailly, a computer is a *large* collection of two-position switches (\"on\" or \"off\") along with processors capable of both reading the position of any swtich as well as changing a switches position. We think of the \"off\" position as being the number 0 and the \"on\" as the number 1.\n\nEach switch is called a *bit*.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So, let's talk a bit (sorry, again) about number base systems. We use a base-10 system, where we interpret the position of a digit (any of 0, 1, 2, ..., 9) in a number like 5206 in terms of powers of 10:  $$5206 = 5 \\times 10^3 + 2 \\times 10^2 + 0 \\times 10^1 + 6 \\times 10^0.$$ This works for decimal numbers as well:  $$21.784 = 2 \\times 10^1 + 1 \\times 10^0 + 7 \\times 10^{-1} + 8 \\times 10^{-2} + 4 \\times 10^{-3}.$$\n\nBut, there is really nothing special about base-10.\n\nIn a computer, we use base-2, which has two possible bits (from \"binary digit\"), either 0 or 1, again corresponding to the \"off\" and \"on\" from above. Then, $$101101_2 = 1 \\times 2^5 + 0 \\times 2^4 + 1 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 45_{10},$$ where we add the subscript to indicate which base we are in.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Converting from binary to base 10 is pretty simple.
