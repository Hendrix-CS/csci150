# Wednesday & Friday in class are primarily about the final project
# Come with your questions about your project:
#  - I will wander around and help
#  - This goes best if you have specific, detailed questions
#  - It is not a great time for me to help you write a large function/class

# Lab this week is also devoted to the final project
# - Attendance counts!
# - There is still an exit form to fill out!

# Grade questions? See me (or Lab instructor if it is primarily about lab)

# In class today:
#  - We played around with my simple 'Generative AI'
#  - Code is shared on Teams, since it is multiple files
#  - How do LLMs (Large Language Models) work?

#  - What is an acceptable use?
#      - Examples
#      - Stack Exchange, also
