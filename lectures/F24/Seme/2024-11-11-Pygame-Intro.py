# PyGame is a libray that:
#  * Allows us to draw shapes on a window!
#  * Detects keyboard and mouse input
#  * can also play sound
#  * display image files

# When you use this file, at the top, you see:

# import pygame
# from pygame.locals import * # this lets you have more control

# Likely, the pygame is underlined in red
# Hover over the word pygame and choose 'Install Package pygame'
# The red should disappear!
