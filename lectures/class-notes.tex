\item Play some music?
\item Meet students.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What is Computer Science?}

This class is Foundations of Computer Science.  What is Computer
Science?  Look at each component separately.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{What is a computer?}  Get some responses.
\item \textbf{What do computers do?}  Lots of things.  Commonality:
  information.  Communicating, transforming, analyzing, storing.
\item \textbf{What is science?}  Get some responses.  Scientists use
  rational investigation \& analysis, mathematics, etc. to study the
  natural world.
\end{itemize}

So what do computer scientists study?  \textbf{NOT computers!}
Rather, \textbf{information} = anything that can be expressed digitally,
i.e. with numbers/symbols.  ``Computer science'' is actually a bad
name, \emph{cf.}\ ``telescope science''.  Information structure of the
universe.

Why study it?
\begin{itemize}
\item Beautiful ideas, new ways of thinking.
\item Many applications!  Can contribute directly to human flourishing.
\item Computers are everywhere.  Understanding principles of CS =
  being an informed, engaged citizen.

\end{itemize}
Could do this without a computer, but computers are
excellent enabling tools.

\subsection*{Administrivia}

\begin{itemize}
\item Syllabus review online.
\item Academic integrity.
\item BYOL.
\item Moodle.
\item Office hours.
\item Remember to come to lab!
\end{itemize}

For next time:

\begin{itemize}
\item Read chapter 1 of textbook.
\item Do HW 0, ``who are you'', if not already done.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Scratch intro}

Basic intro to Scratch for first lab.

\section{Foo bar}

\subsection*{IRC}

Show IRC channel.  Explain what it is for.  Have everyone log in.
