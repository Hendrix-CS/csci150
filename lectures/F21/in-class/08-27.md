# Algorithm
* A step-by-step list of instructions.
* Many examples beyond computing

## 5 Aspects of Computational Algorithms
* Input
  * How to give the algorithm information
  * Examples
    * What blocks you chose
	* Mouse movements
	* Elements of the Minecraft world
* Output
  * How to get information out of the algorithm
  * Examples
    * Creating blocks in Minecraft
	* Moving the character
	* Character success/failure
	* Seeing the mouse pointer
* Math
  * Computers are really very fast machines for doing math
* Conditionals
  * `If` --- decide what to do based on the answer to a question.
  * Minecraft: check if there is a certain block.
* Repetition
  * Do the same thing many times.
  * Minecraft: Repeat instructions a certain number of times.
  
## 3 kinds of errors

### Syntax 
* Something that is not a valid program
* Like a grammatical error
* Minecraft didn't have these --- makes things much easier!

### Runtime
* Valid program, but something goes wrong while it is running,
  causing the program to end.
  * Division by zero
  * Minecraft
    * Fall in lava
	* Run into creeper

### Semantic
* Valid program that doesn't do what you intended.
  * Computer has no idea what you want!
  * Turning "what you want" into a list of instructions is the challenge.
* Minecraft
  * Walking in circles
  * Fail to achieve goal, but still safe
