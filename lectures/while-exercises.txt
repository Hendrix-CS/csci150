1. Write a loop that counts the number of digits that appear in a 
string received from the user.  For example, if the user inputs 
"12a3rt5", the answer would be "4 digits". 

2. Write a loop that requests a sequence of inputs from the user. 
The loop will end when the user types “ENTER”. The first three 
letters of each input should be put together into a variable 
called "prefixes" which is printed out at the end.

3. Write a loop that requests a sequence of inputs from the user. 
The loop will end when the user enters a non-integer. The sum 
of all the numbers should be printed out at the end.

4. Write a loop like the previous one, except that it adds up the
odd numbers only.

5. Write a loop like #2, except that the sum of the lengths of the 
inputs is printed.

6. Write a loop that simulates a gambling game. The player starts 
with $100. Each time, the player is asked for a bet. The player
wins 30% of the time and loses 70% of the time. On a win, the player
wins double the bet. On a loss, the player loses the total bet. The loop 
ends when the player runs out of money.

7. Implement the Collatz conjecture. Ask the user for a value to start, 
then iterate through the sequence until you reach 1. Recall that if
the number is odd, the next number is 3n + 1, and if the number is even,
the next number is the current number divided by two.

8. Implement the reverse of the guessing game, where the human thinks of
a number, and the computer must use binary search to alter its guess.

9. Write a loop that only ends when the user has typed in a valid 
floating point number (something that can be parsed by float()).
