# Strings!

# Strings are sequences of characters.
# If s is a string, we can use s[i] to get the index i character out.
# The indices start at 0.

# The length of the string is len(s).
# Indices go from 0 to len(s)-1.

# s[a:b]  is called a "slice"
#    -- gives the substring starting at index a, up to but not
#       including index b.
# s[a:] goes to the end
# s[:b] starts at the beginning
#
# Negative indices count from the end backwards.
#
# + "concatenates" (sticks together) two strings.
# * of a string and an int copies the string.
#
# There are lots of functions you can call on strings, for example:
#   - s.upper()
#   - s.count()
#   - s.replace()
#   - s.find()
#   - s.isdigit()
