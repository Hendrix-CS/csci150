# This is a .py file -- a single file that the Python interpreter can run
#
# I am using the IDE PyCharm to edit and run the file
#
# You should download Python3 (python.org) &
# PyCharm (jetbrains.com/pycharm) -- make sure to download the free "Community Edition"

# Install both

# I will share this file on the class Team page
# *Download it*

# If you haven't yet, create a folder somewhere for this class
# Open PyCharm and select 'New Project' from the top menu

# Give the Project a name -- something like 'Code from Class'
# Navigate to your CSCI 150 folder
# Make sure the Interpreter type is 'Project Venv'
# Python Version should be Python3

# I *strongly* recommend you create a new project for 'Labs' another for 'Homework,' etc
# Some students make new projects for *each* lab instead, which is fine.


# Ok, now you are ready to check if your set-up is correct.

# Move this file from your downloads into the folder for this project
# open it
# Go to the 'Run' top menu and Run the file
# If it opens a window at the bottom and prints 'Hello World'
# and says "Process finished with exit code 0'
# You have successfully installed Python &  PyCharm. -- You can leave


print('Hello World')
