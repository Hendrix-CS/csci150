# returns true if c is in s, false otherwise

# given a list of ints, return True if there are an even number of odd integers

### Caution -- you should *NOT* ever adjust the iterable in the loop!

def do_not_do_this(lst):
    for item in lst:
        lst.append(5)

    return lst

#### for loops -- important
# inside a for loop, you should not change either the value of the
# looping variable itself, nor the iterable that is being looped over!**

# ** It is ok to change an individual value in a list,
# ** do not change a string "in place" as you loop over the string
