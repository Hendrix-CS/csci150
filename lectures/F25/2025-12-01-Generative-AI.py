# Wednesday (and some of Friday?) in class are primarily about the final project
# Come with your questions about your project:
#  - I will wander around and help
#  - This goes best if you have specific, detailed questions
#  - It is not a great time for me to help you write a large function/class

# Lab this week is also devoted to the final project
# - Attendance counts!

# Grade questions? See me (or Lab instructor if it is primarily about lab)


# "Thinking" Machines

# Eliza -- the first chatbot -- implementation at https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html

# Machine Learning -- various type of trial-and-error learning
# - optimization problems
# - genetic algorithms
# - neural networks

# Generative AI & LLMs
# - use a (large) corpus of text
# - make predictions of the next word(s) based on previous word(s)


# Ethical Issues
# - where does the text come from -- copyright?
# - resource usage
# - what are the incentives?

# They choose the "mostly likely" next word/phrase and sound reasonable
# “I’ll go down this thread with [Chat]GPT or Grok and I’ll start to get
# to the edge of what’s known in quantum physics and then I’m doing the equivalent of vibe coding,
# except it’s vibe physics,” Kalanick explained. “And we’re approaching what’s known.
# And I’m trying to poke and see if there’s breakthroughs to be had.
# And I’ve gotten pretty damn close to some interesting breakthroughs just doing that.”

# How would he (a non-physicist) know he was "close"
# My personal experience -- in domains I know nothing or a little bit about
# the answers often seem reasonable (and some of them are probably correct)
# but in domains I have expertise in, I regularly spot subtle (and sometimes not subtle) errors!

# The "Hallucination" problem
# - made up citations
# - claims that are obviously false
# - claims certainty

# Academic World
# - what is the point of assignments?
# - incentives can be misaligned
# - if a computer writes the paper and a computer grades the paper ...


# Fun!
# - Shakespeare sonnet generator
# - he wrote 154 sonnets
# - each(*) are 14 lines, 3 quatrains in iambic pentameter, ABAB
#    followed by a rhyming couplet.


# Other text generator



# In class today:
#  - We played around with my simple 'Generative AI'
#  - Code is shared on Teams, since it is multiple files
#  - How do LLMs (Large Language Models) work?

#  - What is an acceptable use?
#      - Examples
#      - Stack Exchange, also
