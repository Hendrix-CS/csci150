Important things to say at some point

- Academic integrity
- I'm going to tell you big ideas.  I can't guarantee I will cover all
  details in class.  You are responsible for reading the book, playing
  around, asking if you are confused or missing something.
- Reading over your notes DOES NOTHING.  Best way to study is to
  practice writing code.  Rewrite code from class, play around, write
  something and predict outcome, etc.
