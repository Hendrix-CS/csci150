<h1><a href="../index.html">CSC207</a> - Lab 6<br>Edible Mushroom Detector</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This lab
we investigate some pieces of "intelligence," using our ability to divide objects into categories.

<hr>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python
<li>Tables below on Mushrooms
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<img class="entryimageright" src="../images/mushroom.jpeg">While the formal system of Boolean logic was developed by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>, 
the study of logic has roots as far back as Ancient Greece and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and his foundational work on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism">Syllogisms</a>.  Our ability to reason
logically and rationally is often cited as a primary indicator of our intelligence, not only on an
individual level as measured by SAT and IQ tests, but also on a species level to distinguish our
actions and behaviors from other organisms. As we search for life in the universe, we
ultimately hope to find intelligent life elsewhere capable of communication; today we will spend
our first lab understanding the basics of intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) is a field within computer science with the goal of recreating, through 
the user of a computer, the 
intelligence we see in human behavior. The goal of AI has yet to be achieved on a broad sense,
but much progress has been made in the fields of logic and categorization.  We tackled
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning">deductive reasoning</a> 
last lab with <a href="http://www.welovepuzzles.com">logic puzzles</a>, 
deducing a conclusion of what must be true from the facts presented to us.  Today we'll focus on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">inductive logic</a>: our ability
to make generalizations based on data and apply these general rules to new situations.

Imagine you are tasked by the <a href="http://www.audubon.org/">Audobon Society</a> to develop
an electronic field guide on mushrooms.  They present you with the following ten example mushrooms 
above, listing a few of their attributes.  The most important category is if a mushroom is edible
or not, however, this is the only category you cannot directly observe from the mushroom without
eating it.  They would like a way to make decisions about newly found mushrooms which is 
based on the information above, and simple enough for someone to remember the edible rule even
without the field guide.
<p>
Using what you know about <code>if-elif-else</code> statements, write a python program called
<code>mushroom_detector.py</code>.  First, ask the user to input the data they observe on a 
single mushroom, using <code>gill_spacing</code>, <code>cap_shape</code>, <code>color</code>, 
<code>bruises</code> and <code>ring_number</code>.   Using this data, construct three
if-elif-else statements that will correctly categorize all of the above training data mushrooms, 
using the following restrictions for each statement:  

<ol>
<li>Only use color and bruises
<li>Only use gill_spacing
<li>Only use cap_shape and ring_number
</ol>
Output to the user the classification found by each statement, either "edible" or "poisonous", so
that you will have four independent judgements made, saying "edible" or "poisonous" for each one.
<p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
We now wish to evaluate how your field guide will work on unseen data.
Test your <code>mushroom_detector.py</code> program with the following data.  What is the predicted 
value for edible/poisonous for each mushroom on each statement?  Which statement would you recommend using?

<tr><td>4</td><td>"sunken"</td><td>"red"</td><td>False</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>"bell"</td><td>"red"</td><td>True</td><td>2</td></tr>

<h3>What To Hand In</h3>
Log in to <code>cs.centenary.edu</code> through either Secure FTP or WinSCP using your
cs login and password, putting your code in the directory called 
called <code>lab6</code>.  Write up your four if-elif-else statements from step 1 in a file 
called <code>mushroom_detector.py</code>. Write the results of 
each test example in step 2 with each if-elif-else statement above into a Google Doc 
and share it with me.
<p>

You must hand in:
<ul>
 	<li>mushroom_detector.py
 	<li>Lab 6 Evaluation Google Doc
</ul>
