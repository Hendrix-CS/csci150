<h2>Overview</h2>
This lab will make extensive use of dictionaries to demonstrate how text entry on cell phones
is feasible.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping">Python dictionaries</a>
<li><a href="../data/all.num.o5">BNC word frequency list</a>
</ul>


<h2>Description</h2>
<img class="entryimageright" src="../images/keypad.jpg">
One of the most popular modules of any cell phone is the text messaging abilities.  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_text">Predictive Text</a> is a fast and easy
text entry system for cell phones, the most common algorithms being <a href="http://www.t9.com/us/">t9</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITap">iTap</a>.  This lab will examine the details of
predictive text algorithms and some of the unexpected consequences.
<p>
As society moves to smart phones like the iPhone and Palm Pre with software Qwerty keyboards,
this interesting piece of computer science will become a forgotten artifact, but the lessons of
predictive text will still be applicable when faces with similar limitations.


<h3>Step 1</h3>
The standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad">telephone pad</a> includes
12 keys, 10 for numbers 0-9, plus the * and # symbols. Along with the numbers printed on the keys,
most phones include three to four letters, in the following pattern:
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>
<tr><th>Number</th><th>Letters</th><tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>ABC</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>DEF</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>GHI</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>JKL</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>MNO</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>PQRS</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>TUV</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>WXYZ</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Write a function called <code>text_to_nums(text)</code> which will translate a given string of 
text into the numbers which should be pressed on the keypad to create this text.  You should use a 
dictionary with the letters as keys and the numbers as values.  Be sure to remove all punctuation
from the text, capitalize all the incoming text, and translate the space character as "*".

<h3>Step 2</h3>
Translation from letters to numbers is relatively straight forward.  However, the task of 
translating back from numbers into letters is more challenging.  Given the numbers 2665, it is
not immediately clear which word the user intended, since each digit maps to three or four
letters.
<p>
A <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=textonym">textonym</a> is a word that
is composed of the same underlying numeric key.  For example, "cool" is mapped to 2665, which 
is also the same number for "book".
<p>
To automatically make a choice between these two words we need some more information.  Predictive
text algorithms use the relative likelihood of the words in the English language.  We will be using
statistics gathered from the <a href="http://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html">British 
National Corpus</a>, a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language 
from a wide range of sources.  We have a <a href="../data/all.num.o5">BNC word frequency list</a>,
with each line listing the word count followed by the word and some extra information on the part
of speech.
<p>
Now, we can translate a number back into it's most likely word choice.
Since "book" is more popular in this corpus than "cool", it will be the first 
word returned when typing in those numbers.
<p>
Write a function called <code>nums_to_text(nums)</code> which will translate a given string of
numbers separated by "*" into the most likely words that created this string of numbers. Use a
dictionary with the numbers as keys and the most likely word as the value.
<p>
Use your function to translate the following numbers back into the most likely text.
<p>
<ul>
<li>84373*47*6684464*97664*9484*9687*8353847466*738*36*668*2883678*86*235878*843*7428873
<li>2633*666539*8379*746753*626
</ul>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
Write a separate function called <code>textonyms(text)</code> to find all textonyms for a given word.
<p>
Use your function to find the textonyms of the following words:
<ul>
<li>barmaid
<li>awake
</ul>
Incorporate this into your <code>nums_to_text</code> function above, such that all possible
text messages are printed out.
<h3>Step 4</h3>
So far we have been translating complete texts.  One other way to speed up our entry of words
is to add some predictive element to our text entry.  For example, if a user types in 
637, your program should prompt them that "message" is the most likely word.  This way you need
fewer key presses to make longer words.
<p>
Write a function called <code>predict_text()</code> to allow the user to enter numbers and create
a text message. This function will repeatedly ask the user for individual
numbers, and after each letter, will display the most likely word that starts with the sequence of 
numbers entered.  If the user hits enter without a number, add this most likely word to a 
growing text message and start the next word from scratch.  If the user hits enter without a 
number twice in a row, print the written text message for the user and exit the function.

<h2>Extensions</h2>
Our algorithm above is feasible, but can be improved in many ways.  Suggest a few 
improvements and what changes they will require in your code.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
Write up your found answers for each of the steps above in a file called <code>lab12_evaluation.txt</code>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Log in to <code>cs.centenary.edu</code> through either Secure FTP or WinSCP using your
cs login and password.  Create a subdirectory from <code>csc207</code> 
called <code>lab12</code>.  Copy your <code>substitution.py</code> project into this directory.  Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
You must hand in:
<ul>
 	<li>texting.py
	<li>lab12_evaluation.txt
</ul>
