<h1><a href="../index.html">CSC207</a> - Lab 9<br>Cryptogram Decipherment</h1>
<h3>Assigned October 27th 2 p.m.<br>
Due October 29th 4 p.m.</h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Continuing on the topic of decipherment, we now look at more complicated substitution ciphers.
We will build a program to assist us in deciphering cryptograms using Python dictionaries.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/typesmapping.html">Python dictionaries</a>
<li><a href="../data/alice-chapter-one.txt">Alice Chapter One</a>
<li>frequency_count(s) function from <a href="lab8.html">Lab 8</a>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
Last lab, we explored finding automatic solutions to the Caesar Cipher, where the alphabet
was rotated to provide a rudimentary form of encryption.  We demonstrated
that messages encoded in a Caesar Cipher are easily decoded.  A stronger encryption
method is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">Substitution Cipher</a>.
Examples of substitution ciphers can be found in the Sherlock Holmes short story called 
<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dancing_Men">The Dancing Men</a>, and in
the <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/futurama.htm">Alien</a>
<a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/Interactive/AlienCodec/">languages</a> from the
cartoon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a>.
<p>
In a substitution cipher, a letter can be replaced by any other letter or symbol, 
such that each letter is only used once per original letter. For example, given the 
mapping for Alien Language 1 below:
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://futurama.yellopants.com/al1/images/desc01.jpg"><p>
<b>Alien Language 1</b>
</div>
<p>
We can decode the sign behind Bender here to say
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://futurama.yellopants.com/al1/images/DVDfutur005.JPG"><p>
<b>TASTY HUMAN BURGERS</b>
</div>
<p>
If we know the mapping for substitution, decipherment is easy, however, we are often
given encrypted text, and we must discover the map on our own.
In this lab, we will be building a program to assist the user in decoding 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram">Cryptograms</a>, a common version
of a substitution cipher found in the daily newspapers.  The program will use 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/typesmapping.html">Python dictionaries</a>
to map one character to another for translation, and provide the current best mapping
based on character frequencies.

<h3>Step 1</h3>
As with a Caesar cipher, information will be leaked from the ciphertext in the form of 
the frequency counts of each letter.  Recall the standard frequency counts for words
in the English language:
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/English-slf.png"><p>
<b>Figure 1: English letter frequencies</b>
</div>
<p>
However, we no longer have only 25 possibilities for decryption, since we are substituting letters
individually instead of rotating them as a whole. In fact, there are 1.551121 x 10 ^ 25 (25!)
possible ways to decrypt the text, since A can stand for any of the 25 other letters, B then
stands for one of the 24 left, etc.
<p>
Our approach here will be what is called a greedy search. We will select the letter-match that looks the 
most probable, then the second most probable, until we have chosen 26 matchings, one for each
letter in the alphabet. We will choose the most probable match by saying the highest-frequency
letter in the ciphertext will be mapped to the highest-frequency letter in the reference text,
and then remove these letters from being selected in subsequent matchings.
This will not be a great solution, but will give us somewhere to start.
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="../images/crypto.jpg">
<p>
<b>Figure 2: Ciphertext letter frequencies</b>
</div>
<p>
For example, if we were using the greedy search on the above frequencies from Figure 2 from a ciphertext and the 
earlier reference frequencies of Figure 1, we would first pick P stand for E since they are both the highest peaks.
The next two highest peaks are Y and T, then D and A, etc, matching them one by one until
all 26 letters are matched.
<p>
Create a function <code>frequency_map(o_freq, e_freq)</code> that will return a dictionary 
mapping of characters based on the above greedy search. 
<p>Test your function in the interpreter. Use 
<a href="../code/alice-chapter-one.txt">Chapter One of Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland</a> as your reference text to calculate expected frequencies in e_freq, 
and Quote 1 from the Evaluation section below as your ciphertext to calculate o_freq.
Your returned frequency map should be
<p>
<pre>
{'A': 'J', 'C': 'S', 'B': 'I', 'E': 'Q', 'D': 'T', 'G': 'U', 'F': 'L', 'I': 'H', 
 'H': 'V', 'K': 'D', 'J': 'W', 'M': 'R', 'L': 'C', 'O': 'Y', 'N': 'B', 'Q': 'A', 
 'P': 'E', 'S': 'P', 'R': 'G', 'U': 'X', 'T': 'N', 'W': 'K', 'V': 'F', 'Y': 'O', 
 'X': 'M', 'Z': 'Z'}
</pre>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
The next function we create will use the map from <code>frequency_map</code> and 
translate our ciphertext into plaintext.  For each character in our text that is a letter in
<code>"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"</code>, look up that letter as a key in the map and substitute the 
associated value into the text.  Write a function <code>decrypt_sub(s, map)</code> to decrypt the 
string s with the substitution map.
<p>
Test your code on Quote 1 and the frequency map you calculated in Step 1.  It should 
return the following text:
<blockquote>
UEONDR! OCBTA UEIAFL DIYIAF IA T CARESFSNCAR WTYE, GOIWO OTL T BNCHO NKEA HNGTSRL HOE DIFOH TAR SETWOIAF TDD TDNAF HOE WTYE; OESE HOEM OTYE UEEA PSNB HOEIS WOIDRONNR, TAR OTYE HOEIS DEFL TAR AEWVL WOTIAER LN HOTH HOEM WTAANH BNYE, TAR WTA NADM LEE UEPNSE HOEB, UEIAF KSEYEAHER UM HOE WOTIAL PSNB HCSAIAF SNCAR HOEIS OETRL.

</blockquote>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
This may be the mapping that is likely according to frequency counts, but as we see above, this is 
not perfect, the message is still unintelligible. Almost always, this will not
be the right translation. To find the correct message, we must 
revise our map by interacting with the user.  
<p>
Write a function called <code>user_map(map)</code> which brings in a current map from the 
user and prompts them to add one more character key and value to this map.  This augmented map
is then returned.
<p>
One restriction we will place on the user is that they are not allowed to map
two different letters to the same letter.  In other words, a letter cannot appear
twice in the list of values inside our character map.  If the user tries to do this,
you should tell them that is an invalid mapping, and prompt them again for a new mapping.
<p>
Test out your function by starting with the empty map {} and adding a new character key-value map
of G -> B.
Then use this map as your input and add a new mapping of Y -> H.
<h3>Step 4</h3>
With this new incremental map from the user, we need to use that and revise our previous 
map-creation function.
Revise <code>frequency_map(o_freq, e_freq)</code> from Step 1 into 
<code>frequency_map(map, o_freq, e_freq)</code>to take into account the user map.  It should
remove from consideration any characters mappings the user has specified, and fill in the rest 
based on the remaining frequency counts, to return a full map.
<p>
Test your code with your frequencies from Step 1 and the map from Step 3.  Your function should
generate the following frequency map:
<p>
<pre>
{'A': 'J', 'C': 'S', 'B': 'I', 'E': 'Q', 'D': 'T', 'F': 'L', 'I': 'A', 'H': 'V', 
 'K': 'D', 'J': 'W', 'M': 'R', 'L': 'F', 'O': 'C', 'N': 'M', 'Q': 'O', 'P': 'E', 
 'S': 'P', 'R': 'U', 'U': 'X', 'T': 'N', 'W': 'K', 'V': 'G', 'X': 'Y', 'Z': 'Z',
 'G': 'B', 'Y': 'H'}
</pre>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
Now that we have all our basic functions built and tested, we can create the final main function to
power this Cryptogram Assistant. Your main function should at least do:
<ul>
<li>Ask the user for the string they wish to decrypt.
<li>Find the expected frequency counts and the observed frequency counts.
<li>Create an initial greedy mapping based on these count.
<li>Display the first guess at decryption to the user along with the original string.
<li>While the user still wishes to make changes:
<ul>
<li>Get from the user an additional character map.
<li>Revise the greedy mapping, and redisplay the new guess at decryption.
</ul>
</ul>
You may find more pieces of information useful as the user; add these as you feel appropriate in 
a format that you can understand.
