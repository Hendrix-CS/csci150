## Description

For this project, you will create a program for users to play a [word
game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game) of your choice.

In particular, your project should be complex enough that it includes
several of the following concepts we have discussed in class:

*   Booleans
*   Functions
*   Conditional statements
*   Loops
*   Strings
*   Lists
*   File input/output
*   Dictionaries
*   Classes and Objects

(It is not an absolute requirement for your program to contain every
single one of the above elements; but if it does not need most of them,
then your program is probably not interesting/complex enough.) The game
can be for one person against a computer, or two players against each
other.

Some examples include:

*   [Bulls and Cows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows) *using words, not numbers*
*   [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))
*   [Last Letter First
    Letter](http://www.greatschools.org/students/activities/slideshows/2812-family-word-games.gs?page=3)
    using countries, state names, foods, etc.
*   [Ghost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_%28game%29)
*   [Boggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle)
*   [Prolix](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39635/prolix)
*   a program to let a user solve a
    [Cryptogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram)

**Do not feel limited by the games on this list**. Find a game that
interests you and implement it. If you choose something else, check with
one of your instructors first, so we can advise you on the scope of your project.

## Requirements

Your program should explain the game to the user, being clear exactly
what input is expected and valid whenever requesting information from
them.

The user must be able to

* choose a level of difficulty for the game,

* be offered the chance to play the game again when finished, and

* make mistakes in entry of information and be prompted to correct their
input.

**Your code must make good use of functions**. Using functions will reduce
the amount of code you need to write as well as make your program easier
to debug. However, do not write [spaghetti
code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code), where functions call
each other back and forth to continue execution of the program; let your
functions naturally return values and use loops to repeat the game
turns.

## Warnings

*   **Get started early**! Pick a game and run it by us. We are happy to
    help you think through the design of your program.
*   If you are not confident with the use of functions to structure your
    code, we highly recommend *first* getting something very basic to
    work without using functions, then thinking about how to abstract
    parts of your code into functions. Then repeat the process, adding
    functionality incrementally.
*   Historically, project 2 is the point in the semester where some
    students become **tempted to cheat** by copying others' code. Do
    not succumb to this temptation! Review the [Academic
    Integrity](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/ac-integrity-policy.html)
    guidelines for CSCI. Get started early, come for help often.  You
    **can** do this project!

## What to Hand In

You must hand in all files necessary to run your code.


## Grading Criteria
* A **Partially Complete** project:
  * Explains the game to the user, making clear exactly what input
    is expected and valid whenever it requests information from them.
  * Enables the human player to play a word game to completion without any errors.
  * The word game is complex enough to employ at least **three** of the concepts from the list above.
* A **Complete** project meets the criteria for **Partially Complete**, and meets the following additional criteria:
  * The word game is complex enough to employ at least **five** of the concepts from the list above.
  * Has at least three levels of difficulty.
  * Offers the chance to play the game again when finished.
  * Enables the user to correct mistakes in the entry of information.
  * Makes good use of functions.
  * Contains no "spaghetti code".
