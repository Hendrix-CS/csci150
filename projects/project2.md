# Project 2: Word Games


## Description

For this project, we will explore more complex interactions with the
user by implementing conditional statements and loops. You will create a
program for users to play a [word game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game)
of your choice.

In particular, your project should be complex enough that it includes
the following concepts we have discussed in class:

*   Booleans
*   Functions
*   Conditional Statements
*   While Loops
*   Strings
*   Lists

(It is not an absolute requirement for your program to contain every
single one of the above elements; but if it does not need most of them,
then your program is probably not interesting/complex enough.) The game
can be for one person against a computer, or two players against each
other.

Some examples are

*   [Last Letter First
    Letter](http://www.greatschools.org/students/activities/slideshows/2812-family-word-games.gs?page=3)
    using Countries, State Names, Foods, etc.
*   [Bulls and Cows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows)
*   [Ghost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_%28game%29)
*   [Boggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle)
*   [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble)
*   [Prolix](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39635/prolix)
*   a program to let a user solve a
    [Cryptogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram)

**Do not feel limited by the games on this list**. Find a game that
interests you and implement it. If you choose something else, check with
me first, so I can advise you on the scope of your project.

## Requirements

You should explain the game to the user, being clear exactly what input
is expected and valid whenever requesting information from them.

The user must be able to

* choose a level of difficulty for the game,

* be offered the chance to play the game again when finished, and

* make mistakes in entry of information and be prompted to correct their
input.

Your code must make good use of functions. Using functions will reduce
the amount of code you need to write as well as make your program easier
to debug. However, do not write [spaghetti
code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code), where functions call
each other back and forth to continue execution of the program; let your
functions naturally return values and use loops to repeat the game
turns.

## Warnings

*   **Get started early**! Pick a game and run it by me. I am happy to
    help you think through the design of your program.
*   If you are not confident with the use of functions to structure your
    code, I highly recommend *first* getting something very basic to
    work without using functions, then thinking about how to abstract
    parts of your code into functions. Then repeat the process, adding
    functionality incrementally.
*   Historically, project 2 is the point in the semester where some
    students become **tempted to cheat** by copying others' code. Do not
    succumb to this temptation! Get started early, come for help often.
    You **can** do this project!

## What to Hand In

You must hand in all files necessary to run your code.

Make sure you have followed the [Python Style Guide](../python_style_guide.html),
and have run your project through
the Automated Style Checker.
