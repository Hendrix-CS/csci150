<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Project 1<br>This Day in History</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Many systems have been devised over the years for keeping time.  In this project, you will
explore some of the oddities present in our current calendar system by using a formula 
to calculate the day of the week for any given day between 1700 and 2299.
<p>
In particular, this project will cover the following concepts we have discussed in class:
<ul>
	<li>Input / Output
	<li>Math module
	<li>String access
	<li>Conditionals
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
Over the centuries, our calendar has been realigned many times to coincide with growth in
our astronomical knowledge. Incorporating elements of both the solar and lunar cycle, the
current international standard calendar is the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian Calendar</a>, first
adopted in 1582. There are 
seven days a week due to religious influence, 12 months to a year in honor of
the lunar cycle, and 365 days a year in relation to the earth's orbital period
around the sun, with enough
leap days included to properly align the system with the true 
orbital period of approximately 365.242190419 days.  
While better than the Egyptian and Roman calendars in use at the time of adoption, it is still
an approximation with room for improvement, from the more-precise 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendar">Iranian Calendar</a> to
a standardized and perpetual 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Calendar">World Calendar</a>. 
<p>
One of the more interesting quirks of the Gregorian Calendar is that
each year can start on a different day of the week, since 365 is not
a multiple of 7. But there is a simple algorithm (based on the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Algorithm">Doomsday Rule</a>) that 
you can memorize to find the day of the 
week for any date between 
Jan 1st, 1700 and Dec 31st, 2299:
<ol>
	<li>Find the last 2 digits of the year. Divide this by four (using integer division) 
	and sum these two together to get <code>y</code>.
   	<li>Get the corresponding offset (shown below) for the month for <code>m</code>.
   	<li>Take the day to get <code>d</code>
   	<li>Add <code>y</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>d</code> together to find <code>dow</code>.
	<li>Add the year offset (also shown below) to <code>dow</code>.
	<li>If the year is a leap year and the month is January or February, subtract 1 from 
	<code>dow</code>.
   	<li><code>dow</code> mod 7 corresponds to the day of the week. (0 = Sunday, 
   	1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.)
</ol>

<div align="center">
<b>Table for Month Offset</b>
<p>
<table border=1><tr>
<th>Jan</th><th>Feb</th><th>Mar</th><th>Apr</th><th>May</th><th>Jun</th>
<th>Jul</th><th>Aug</th><th>Sep</th><th>Oct</th><th>Nov</th><th>Dec</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>6</th><th>2</th><th>2</th><th>5</th><th>0</th><th>3</th>
<th>5</th><th>1</th><th>4</th><th>6</th><th>2</th><th>4</th></tr>

<p>
</div>

<div align="center">
<b>Table for Year Offset</b>
<p>
<table border=1><tr>
<th>1700</th><th>1800</th><th>1900</th><th>2000</th><th>2100</th><th>2200</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>5</th><th>3</th><th>1</th><th>0</th><th>-2</th><th>-4</th></tr>
</table>
<p>
</div>

For example, if you wish to know the day of the week for February 23rd, 2015, these
are the steps you would take:
<ol>
	<li>15 + 3 = 18
	<li>2
	<li>23
	<li>18 + 2 + 23 = 43
	<li>43 + 0 = 43 (offset code = 0)
	<li>43 - 0 = 43 (not a leap year, and not Jan or Feb)
	<li>43 % 7 = 1 for Monday
</ol>

<h3>Leap Year Rule</h3>
Under the Gregorian Calendar, a year is a leap year (such that February has 29 days) if it is a 
multiple of four, except when it is also a multiple of 100 but not 400. So, 1900 and
2100 are not leap years, but 2000 is a leap year.

<h2>Coding</h2>
For this assignment, you will write a Python program called <code>dow.py</code>.
This program will first tell the user about the program, and then take as input from the user 
the date they wish to use for finding the day of the week.  This input must be in the
form of one question to the user, formatted to have the year, then day, then month
with each separated by two dashes. The month and the day must both be two digit 
entries, pad the beginning with 0 if necessary. So the user would type in "2015--02--23" for
February 23rd, 2015.
<p>
With correct input, your program will then parse this input into the year, month and day,
follow the above algorithm to compute the day of the week, and output this to the user
in the following format exactly (using February 23rd, 2015 as an example):
<p>
<code>In the Gregorian Calendar, February 23rd, 2015 falls on a Monday.</code>
<p>
For dates, use st, nd, rd and th suffixes appropriately.

<h2>Testing</h2>
Test your code on the following dates to ensure you are getting the right answers.  I will be 
using other dates to test your project for grading, so you should also find three other dates than 
these for your own testing, one of which is in January or February of a leap year.
<p>
<ul>
	<li>A total solar eclipse will occur over the continental United States on 
	Monday, August 21, 2017.
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message">The Arecibo message</a>
	was beamed into space on Saturday, 16 November 1974.
	<li>Groundhog Day, Sunday, February 2, 1992.
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar">The 
	Mesoamerican Long Count calendar</a> used by the Mayans began a new cycle on
	Friday, December 21, 2012.  Some people thought this would be the end of the world.
	<li>Your birthday.
</ul>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>
You may not use lists or strings to store the offset data. This should be accomplished
with conditionals.

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Log in to <a href="http://moodle.hendrix.edu">Moodle</a>.  
Copy your <code>dow.py</code> project into the directory called 
<code>project1</code>.  Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
You must hand in:
<ul>
 	<li>dow.py
</ul>
