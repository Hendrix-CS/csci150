<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Project 1<br>Decision Trees</h1>
<h3>Assigned September 16<br>
Due September 23</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

For this project, we will explore more complex interactions with the user by implementing
control statements and loops. You will create a program for users to play a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game">word game</a> of your choice.
<p>
In particular, your project should include most of
the following concepts we have discussed in class:
<ul>
	<li>Input / Output
	<li>Math
	<li>Strings, Integers, Floats and Booleans
	<li>Control Statements
</ul>

The game can be for one person against a computer, or two players
against each other.
<p>
Some examples are
<ul>
<li>Fortune Teller
</ul>
Do not feel limited by the suggestions on this list. Find something that
interests you and implement it. If you choose something else, check
with us first, so we can advise you on the scope of your project.
<p>
You should explain your program to the user, being clear exactly what
input is expected and valid whenever requesting information from them.
<p>
The user must be able to enter appropriate information when requested,
and the input they enter must have an impact on the output of the program.
<p>
<h2>Warnings</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Get started early</b>!  Pick an idea and run it by us.  We are happy to help
  you think through the design of your program.</li>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
You must hand in all files necessary to run your code.
<p>
Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
