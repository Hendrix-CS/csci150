\title{CSCI 150: Example final project design}
\author{Brent Yorgey}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

This document exemplifies a final project design.  It should give you
a good sense of the sorts of details we are looking for, though the
project itself (blackjack) is probably too simple for a real final
project.

NOTE XXX projects using cards...

\section{Project description}

In this project, I will develop a program to play the game of
Blackjack with the user. XXX

This project will go beyond what we have done in class in several
ways.  First, XXX.   Second, XXX.

\section{Detailed design}

My initial design calls for six classes: \verb|Card| representing a
single card, \verb|Deck| representing a sequence of cards, \verb|Hand|
(a subclass of \verb|Deck|), \verb|Player| representing a blackjack
player, and \verb|Human| and \verb|Computer| (both subclasses of
\verb|Player|).

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|Card| --- the \verb|Card| class XXX.  Methods:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|fff|
  \end{itemize}
\item \verb|Deck| --- the \verb|Deck| class XXX
\item \verb|Hand(Deck)|
\item \verb|Player|
\item \verb|Human(Player)|
\item \verb|Computer(Player)|
\end{itemize}

In addition, XXX main method and other methods.

\section{Timeline}

My planned timeline for completing the project is as follows:
