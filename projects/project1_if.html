<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Project 1<br>Question/Answer System</h1>
<h3>Assigned September 19<br>
Due Friday, September 23</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

For this project, you will create a program that interacts with a user
by asking questions.  Follow-up questions depend upon the previous 
questions asked. The questions and answers should guide the user towards
solving a concrete problem.

The content of the questions and answers is entirely up to you. The 
program must contain at least six distinct questions it can ask. Every
question after the first question might or might not be asked, depending
on the answers to previous questions.

<h2>Example</h2>

Here are two transcripts from an example system, to give you a sense
as to what your program needs to be able to do.

<pre>
Welcome to the baby helper. Answer "yes" or "no" to each question.
Is your baby sleeping?no
Is she crying?no
Great, leave her alone.
</pre>

<pre>
Welcome to the baby helper. Answer "yes" or "no" to each question.
Is your baby sleeping?no
Is she crying?yes
Does she need a diaper change?yes
Is the diaper merely wet?no
Take off the dirty diaper and throw it out
Clean her thoroughly and put on a clean diaper
Is the diaper bin full?no
Is she cold?no
Is she still crying?yes
She must be hungry. Feed her a bottle.
At this point, she should be okay. If not, I am at a loss...
</pre>
