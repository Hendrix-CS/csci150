<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Project 1<br>Question/Answer System</h1>
<h3>Assigned September 19<br>
Due Friday, September 23</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

For this project, you will create a program that interacts with a user
by asking questions.  Follow-up questions depend upon the previous 
questions asked. The questions and answers should guide the user towards
solving a concrete problem.
<p>
The content of the questions and answers is entirely up to you,
within reason and good taste. You can
ask the user for strings, integers, or floats. The 
program must contain at least <b>six distinct questions</b> it can ask. Every
question after the first question might or might not be asked, depending
on the answers to previous questions.

<h2>Example</h2>

Here are two transcripts from an example system, to give you a sense
as to what your program needs to be able to do. The input from the user 
is colored as blue.

<h3>Transcript 1</h3>
<pre>
Welcome to the baby helper. Answer "yes" or "no" to each question.
Is your baby sleeping? <span>no</span>
Is she crying? <span>no</span>
Great, leave her alone.
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Transcript 2</h3>
<pre>
Welcome to the baby helper. Answer "yes" or "no" to each question.
Is your baby sleeping? <span>no</span>
Is she crying? <span>yes</span>
Does she need a diaper change? <span>yes</span>
Is the diaper merely wet? <span>no</span>
Take off the dirty diaper and throw it out.
Clean her thoroughly and put on a clean diaper.
Is the diaper bin full? <span>no</span>
Is she cold? <span>no</span>
Is she still crying? <span>yes</span>
She must be hungry. Feed her a bottle.
At this point, she should be okay. If not, I am at a loss...
</pre>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<b>Get started early</b>!  Pick an idea and run it by us.  We are happy to help
  you think through the design of your program.

<h2>Grading</h2>
A program will earn a B if it follows the above guidelines for user input and
output, with 6 distinct questions. An A project will also be free of any grammatical errors
and request various types of data (string, integer, float). A 100 project will
also follow the style guide.

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Submit the <code>*.py</code> file containing your program.
<p>
Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
