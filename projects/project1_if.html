<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Project 1<br>Civic Assistance Question/Answer System</h1>
<h3>Assigned September 17<br>
Due Monday, September 25</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>
Many elements of our civic lives are governed by processes and regulations. 
While they may be confusing and complicated, these processes form a common way that we 
coordinate our interactions, hopefully for the benefit of all. We can use our
computing skills to help facilitate a clear understanding of these processes.
<p>
For this project, you will create a program that interacts with a user
by asking questions.  Follow-up questions depend upon the previous 
questions asked. The questions and answers should guide the user towards
solving a concrete problem.
<p>
The content of the questions and answers should be related to a citizen 
interacting with their government in some real-life civic realm. You can
ask the user for strings, integers, or floats. The 
program must contain at least <b>six distinct questions</b> it can ask. Every
question after the first question might or might not be asked, depending
on the answers to previous questions.
<p>
Here is a list of potential interactions you might attempt to simulate. This is 
by no means comprehensive and is meant as inspiration for your program. You may choose 
one of these, or one of your own, as long as you provide a citation in your code
to your connected real-world civic interaction.

<h2>Example</h2>

Here are two transcripts from an example system, to give you a sense
as to what your program needs to be able to do. The input from the user 
is colored as blue.

<h3>Transcript 1</h3>
<pre>
Welcome to the DMV. Would you like to "register" or "renew" a vehicle? <span>register</span>
Has your vehicle been assessed this year? <span>no</span>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<b>Get started early</b>!  Pick an idea and run it by us.  We are happy to help
  you think through the design of your program.

<h2>Grading</h2>
A program will earn a B if it follows the above guidelines for user input and
output, with 6 distinct questions. An A project will also be free of any grammatical errors
and request various types of data (string, integer, float). A 100 project will
also follow the style guide.

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Submit the <code>*.py</code> file containing your program.
<p>
Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
