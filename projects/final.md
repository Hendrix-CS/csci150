## Description

Instead of a final exam, you will complete a final project.

Important dates
---------------

-   Project design due: **{{page.designdue}} @ start of class**
-   Demo session: **{{page.finaldue}}, Final Exam Period**
-   Project due: **{{page.finaldue}} @ Final Exam Period**

Note: Generally, no extensions will be granted for the final project! Exceptions to this may be worked out *at least* two days in advance of a due date.

Guidelines
----------

Unlike the other projects, you may work with one partner for the final
project. You can also work individually if you wish.  If you wish to
work with a partner from the other section, ideally you should pick
one of the two project demo days when you are both available to
present.  Regardless, you should plan to attend the demo day
corresponding to your section in order to see everyone else's projects.

You have wide latitude in choosing what to do for your final project.
The only requirements are that it should be **sufficiently complex** and
should **somehow go beyond what we have done in class or lab**.

Your project
idea **must** be approved by your lecture instructor (who is also happy
to help you brainstorm) via email or conversation prior to the design submission.
**Get started early!** Waiting until just before
the deadline to start thinking about your final project will be too
late.

Projects **must** make use of Python `class`es to encapsulate and
structure data -- or have a well-reasoned explanation as part of the design document about why classes are uncessary.

Design
------

By {{page.designdue}}, you must turn in a design document describing
your project and planning details of how you will implement it.

{% include warning.html content="You should start thinking about, designing, and even
implementing your project before this!" %}

Your design document must include:

-   Your name, and also the name of your collaborator if it is a team project.
-   A description of the way(s) in which your project goes beyond what
    we have done in class and labs.
-   A description of the main algorithm which will control the project.
-   A description of how you envision the project code will be
    decomposed into classes, methods, and functions.
-   A timeline of steps you will take to complete your project with
    deadlines for each step. Plan not just what you must do but the
    ordering of steps that will allow you to complete by the final
    deadline.

You should be as detailed as possible for full credit in your
description. Time spent on the design will pay off immensely as you
implement your project.

A sample design document for Prof. Seme's *Star Trek* game can be
found
[HERE](https://hendrix-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/seme_hendrix_edu/EaY-fc3O7LRHi8WH1e9I3g4BEB2ZBM-df1IQjxfkJMq-FA?e=XuP2ej). You
are welcome to use this as a starting point.

Demo
----

During the scheduled final exam time on {{page.finaldue}} at 9:00am,
everyone will have the opportunity to demo their projects.  We will
meet in {{page.location}}, and split into 2 or 3 groups.  Each group
will have a turn to be prepared to demo their projects while the other
group(s) can wander around and look at everyone else's.

What to turn in
---------------

You should turn in

-   A document explaining how to run your project and any other special
    notes to the grader.
-   **All** the Python source files, data files, etc. necessary to run
    your project.

## Grading Criteria
* A **Level 2** project includes:
  * A design document submitted on-time and meeting the requirements
    given earlier.
  * Project demo on demo day.
  * An implementation in which the following are true:
    * The program is sufficiently complex and goes beyond what we have
	  done in class or lab.
	* Makes appropriate use of classes, methods, and functions
	  to encapsulate and structure data.
	* No runtime errors, including those resulting from erroneous user input.
	* No syntax errors.
	* Instructor feedback is properly incorporated into the final program.
* A **Level 1** project:
  * A design document is submitted.
  * Project demo on demo day.
  * An implementation in which:
    * The program is sufficiently complex and goes beyond what we have
	  done in class or lab.
	* No syntax errors.
