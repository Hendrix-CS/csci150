<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Project 2<br>Word Games</h1>
<h3>Assigned Oct 7<br>
Due Tuesday, Oct 19</h3>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

For this project, we will explore more complex interactions with the user by implementing
control statements and loops. You will create a program for users to play a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game">word game</a> of your choice.
<p>
In particular, your project should be complex enough that it includes
the following concepts we have discussed in class:
<ul>
	<li>Booleans
	<li>Functions
	<li>Control Statements
	<li>While Loops
	<li>For Loops
	<li>Strings
	<li>Lists
</ul>
(It is not an absolute requirement for your program to contain every
single one of the above elements; but if it does not need most of
them, then your program is probably not interesting/complex enough.)

The game can be for one person against a computer, or two players
against each other.
<p>
Some examples are
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.greatschools.org/students/activities/slideshows/2812-family-word-games.gs?page=3">Last Letter First Letter</a> using Countries, State Names, Foods, etc.
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows">Bulls and Cows</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_%28game%29">Ghost</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">Boggle</a>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble">Scrabble</a>
<li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39635/prolix">Prolix</a>
<li>a program to let a user solve
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram">Cryptogram</a>
</ul>
Do not feel limited by the games on this list. Find a game that
interests you and implement it. If you choose something else, check
with me first, so I can advise you on the scope of your project.
<p>
You should explain the game to the user, being clear exactly what
input is expected and valid whenever requesting information from them.
<p>
The user must be able to
<li>choose a level of difficulty for the game,
<li>be offered the chance to play the game again when finished, and
<li>make mistakes in entry of information and be prompted to correct their input.
<p>
Your code must make good use of functions. Using functions will reduce
the amount of code you need to write as well as make your program
easier to debug.  However, do not
write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti
code</a>, where functions call each other back and forth to continue
execution of the program; let your functions naturally return values
and use loops to repeat the game turns.

<h2>Warnings</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Get started early</b>!  Pick a game and run it by me.  I am happy to help
  you think through the design of your program.</li>

<li>If you are not confident with the use of functions to structure your
code, I highly recommend <i>first</i> getting something very basic to
work without using functions, then thinking about how to abstract
parts of your code into functions.  Then repeat the process, adding
  functionality incrementally.</li>

<li>Historically, project 2 is the point in the semester where some
students become <b>tempted to cheat</b> by copying others' code.  Do not
succumb to this temptation!  Get started early, come for help often.
  You <b>can</b> do this project!</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
You must hand in all files necessary to run your code.
<p>
Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
