# Coursework

## <a name="modules">Modules</a>

Most of your work in this course will be organized around a series of
twelve *modules*, each module typically lasting one week and focusing
on a particular topic.  Most modules will have three components:

* A *[lab](#labs)*, in which you get to put into practice what we have been
  learning in class, in partnership with other students and with the
  help of a lab instructor and TAs.

* A *[homework](#hw)* assignment, giving you more individual, focused
  practice following the lab.

* A *[quiz](#quizzes)* that tests your understanding of the relevant concepts and
  skills.

**In order to get credit for a module**, you must complete the **lab**
and receive credit for the **quiz**.  If you do not receive credit for
a quiz, you may retake a new version of the quiz after coming to
office hours with the relevant completed homework assignment; see
below for more details.

The exceptions are:

- Module 7, which has a quiz but no lab
- Module 11, which has a lab but no quiz

### <a name="labs">Labs</a>

Much of your hands-on experience with programming in this course will
be through weekly labs. During each scheduled lab period, you will
spend time working with an assigned partner on a lab exercise, with
the help of the lab instructor and TAs. The lab is due **by the start
of the following lab**.

#### Lab completion and grading

Each lab consists of a series of milestones. At the start of each lab,
you will receive a sheet of paper listing the milestones for that
lab. As you achieve each milestone, you will demonstrate to the
instructor or TA that you have met the milestone, and they will record
this achievement on your checklist. If you complete the lab during the
lab period, hand your checklist to your lab instructor before you
leave the lab. If you require additional time beyond the lab period to
complete the lab, either the instructor or the lab TA can check off
the remaining milestones during office hours. You can then submit the
completed checklist to the instructor at the start of the next lab.

You will work with a partner on each lab assignment. Each partner will
have their own milestone checklist. If you and your partner do not
complete the milestones during the lab period, you should find time
outside of lab to work together to complete it during the following
week.  If this is not possible for some reason, talk to one of the
course instructors. **TAs can only check off lab milestones if both
partners are present.**

#### Late lab submission

Completed labs are due by the start of the following lab (*i.e.*
typically in one week, sometimes two).  **If you cannot submit a lab
by the due date**, you may request an extension by sending a message
to one of your instructors, with a specific new deadline by which you
will submit the lab.  In order to turn in a lab late (*i.e.* after
either the original deadline or your agreed, new deadline if you
requested an extension), you must first schedule an office hours
meeting with an instructor to discuss your progress in the course.

#### Lab attendance

**Lab attendance is required**. If you know you must miss a lab due to
sports travel, illness, or some other reason, you should contact your
lab instructor before lab (or, in the case of emergencies, as soon as
possible).  Your lab absence will then be considered excused.
However, you are still responsible for completing the lab activity on
time.  If you wish, your lab instructor may be able to pair you with
another student who was absent; or you may complete the lab on your
own.  In either case, you are still welcome to get help on the lab
from an instructor or TAs.

Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer Lab**, in the Bailey
Library. As you go through the exterior door of the library, turn
immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic Resource
Center:

Continue through the door at the far end of the hall (just visible in
the above picture) into the first computer lab, and then enter the
second lab at the back.

### <a name="hw">Homework</a>

Each week, you will be given a homework assignment, typically due on
Monday.  These assignments will help you individually practice and
solidify the skills and concepts from a given module, and prepare you
to take the quiz.

If you turn in your homework in class on Monday, it will be checked
and returned to you with feedback on Wednesday, before the
corresponding quiz on Friday.

Homework assignments do not directly contribute to your final grade in the
course. However, they will prepare you for the quizzes; in addition,
if you do not initially receive credit on a quiz, you must complete
the corresponding homework assignment before you may retake the quiz
(see below).

### <a name="quizzes">Quizzes</a>

A short quiz will be given at the end of class on most Fridays. Each
quiz will contain one or more problems or short-answer questions that
should be solvable within 10 minutes or so.

Quizzes are graded credit/no credit.

If you do not receive credit for a quiz, you may retake it as follows:

- Schedule an office hours appointment with an instructor.
- You must bring the quiz and **completed homework assignment** from the
  corresponding module with you to the office hours appointment.  It
  does not matter whether you already completed and turned in the homework
  before taking the quiz, or whether you complete it after realizing
  that you will need to retake the quiz; either way, you must bring it
  with you.
- After going over the quiz and homework, if the instructor is
  satisfied that your understanding has improved, you may retake a
  different version of the same quiz.
- Alternatively, the instructor may give you additional practice
  problems to work before coming back to retake the quiz on a later
  date.

Missed quizzes may be made up on a subsequent quiz day (there will
usually be sufficient time allotted to take more than one quiz), or
you may book an office hours appointment to take a missed quiz.

## <a name="projects">Projects</a>

<!-- <div style="text-align: center"> -->
<!-- <a class="btn btn-primary" href="{{ site.submission }}"> -->
<!--   Project submission form -->
<!-- </a> -->
<!-- </div> -->
<!-- <br/> -->

Projects give you an opportunity to synthesize multiple concepts and
skills from class into a working whole, as well as an opportunity to
engage your creativity.

| # | Name                                                        | Assigned | Due   |
|:-:|-------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|:-----:|
| 1 | [Expert System]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project1_if.html) | 9/17     | 10/1  |
| 2 | [Word Games]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/project2.html)       | 10/13    | 10/29 |
| 3 | [Final Project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/final.html)       | 10/31    | 12/12 |

Each project will have a detailed *specification* explaining the
required criteria for a successful project.  Each project will be
graded out of 3 points:

- 1 point for being turned in on time (late projects may still be
  submitted for a maximum of 2 points)
- 1 point for a project that meets the basic requirements (as
  specified in the project description)
- 1 additional point for a project that meets the full requirements

### Project submission

You may ask for an extension at any time prior to the deadline for
projects 1 and 2: just let an instructor know that you would like an
extension, and specify your new deadline.  A project submitted by the
new, extended deadline will still be considered on time.

The first such request for a given project will be automatically
granted.  Typically, only one extension will be given for each
project; however, requests for additional extensions will be
considered on a case-by-case basis.

Extensions on the final project will only be granted in exceptional
circumstances.

### Project grading

Projects that do not receive full credit will be returned with
detailed feedback explaining what you must revise or improve to
receive a higher grade, along with a new deadline for the revisions.

There will not be an opportunity to revise the final project.
However, you are welcome to visit office hours to get feedback on your
final project along the way; the grade your get on the final project
should not be a surprise.

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

Attendance in this class is not required as part of your grade.
However, we do expect you to attend and appreciate knowing in advance
if you will need to miss class.
