# Coursework

## <a name="hw">Homework</a>

Short homework assignments will be typically assigned on Monday and due the 
following Monday.  Homework with coding practice problems will be submitted 
electronically. By-hand homework should be submitted on physical paper at 
the start of class time -- you can write (neatly) or type and print such 
solutions.

Each correct homework earns **one credit**. Submitting a sincere attempt at 
completing the homework **on time** earns **one additional credit**. If a 
homework is incorrect and does not receive credit, a student who wishes to 
revise the homework will be expected to visit office hours for feedback 
prior to submitting the revision.

## <a name="quizzes">Quizzes</a>

A short quiz will be given at the end of class on most Wednesdays. Each 
quiz will contain one or more short problems that should be solvable within
10 minutes. 

Quizzes are scored as follows:
* **2 credits**: All answers correct
* **1 credit**: At least some answers correct
* **0 credits**: No answers correct

A student may retake a given quiz twice. For each retake, the student must
schedule an office hours appointment. Prior to the appointment, the student
is expected to have run the code from the quiz in Python and achieved an
understanding of why their answers were not correct. At the appointment,
the student will be expected to explain as best they are able why their 
original answers were incorrect and what the correct answers should be.
After a satisfactory explanation, the instructor will give the student
a makeup quiz.

Missing a quiz is **excused** if the student communicates to the instructor
**prior to class that day** that it is necessary for the student to miss class.
A student may book an office hours appointment to take a quiz missed due to
an excused absence.

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**.

Each lab consists of a series of milestones. At the start of each lab, you will receive a sheet of paper listing the 
milestones for that lab. As you achieve each milestone, you will demonstrate to the instructor or TA that you have met the
milestone, and they will record this achievement on your checklist. When you complete all of the lab milestones, you will 
submit the milestone checklist.

If you complete the lab during the lab period, hand your checklist to your lab instructor before you leave the lab. If you
require additional time beyond the lab period to complete the lab, either the instructor or the lab TA can check off the
remaining milestones during office hours. You can then submit the completed checklist to the instructor at the start of 
the next lab.

Each completed lab earns **one credit**. Submitting the completed checklist by the start of the next lab earns 
**one additional credit**.

You will work with a partner on each lab assignment. Each partner will have their own milestone checklist. If they do not 
complete the milestones during the lab period, they should find time outside of lab to work together to complete them. If 
they are unable to do so, only the instructor is authorized to record milestones for students working alone.

**Lab attendance is required**. If an extenuating circumstance impedes the attendance of lab, the student must contact
the lab instructor to discuss that circumstance for the absence to be **excused**. The student is still responsible
for completing the lab activity on-time.

Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic Resource Center. Continue through the door at the far end of the hall into the first computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the back.

## <a name="projects">Projects</a>


You will have three projects in this course. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two to four weeks after they are assigned.

You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

{% include warning.html content="You must work individually on the projects. You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the **code or work you turn in must be your own**. Use of any resources (TA, StackOverflow, ChatGPT, etc) must be cited, and an overreliance on those resources can be counterproductive to developing your own ability to make progress in this and other courses." %}

Each project will be assessed as **Level 1 Complete** or **Level 2 Complete**, with criteria specified individually
for each project. Note that the final project must be submitted on-time to earn credit - no final projects
will be accepted late. Projects earn **credits** as follows:

| Project | Level 1 Complete | Level 2 Complete | On-time Bonus | Maximum Credit |
| ------: | ---------:       | ----------:      | ------------: | -------------: |
| 1       | 2                | 4                | 1             | 5              |

If a project receives less than Level 2 Complete, a student may submit a revised version of the project after an
office hours meeting with the instructor to discuss how the project should be improved.

Attendance in this class is not required as part of your grade.
However, I do expect you to attend and appreciate knowing in advance
