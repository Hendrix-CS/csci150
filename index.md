Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**.


On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work.

**Lab attendance is required**. Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic Resource Center. Continue through the door at the far end of the hall into the first computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the back.

You will have three projects in this course. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two to three weeks after they are assigned.

**You must work individually on the projects.** You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>

There will be three exams. Each exam will have two parts:
* In-class written part: Analysis and tracing of Python code samples. You may also be asked to write short snippets of code.
* Take-home part: At the end of the written exam will appear some Python coding problems, the solutions to which are to be
submitted by the start of the next class period.

* Exam 1: Monday, September 19, covering functions, math, numerical
  data, and conditionals  [Exam #1 Practice](/exams/cs150-exam1-practice-fall2022.pdf)
* Exam 2: Monday, October 24, covering input/output, `while` loops,  strings , and lists  
* Exam 3: Monday, November 21, covering  the heap, dictionaries,  and classes.  

There is no final exam; you will complete a final project instead, as
described above under Projects.

## <a name="grading">Specifications Grading</a>
Each assignment is assessed as **Complete**, **Partially Complete** or **Missing**.
Criteria for the first two categories will be specified for each assignment. Final course
grades are earned based on cumulative assignment outcomes:

* To earn an A in the course, a student will:
  * **Complete** two exams and at least **Partially Complete** the remaining exam.
  * **Complete** all three projects.
  * **Complete** a minimum of eight homework assignments, with the other two at least **Partially Complete**.
  * Up to one unexcused lab absence, and **Complete** a minimum of ten lab assignments, with the other two at least **Partially Complete**.
  * Schedule and attend a minimum of three Office Hours meetings.
* To earn a B in the course, a student will:
  * **Complete** two exams and at least **Partially Complete** the remaining exam.
  * **Complete** a minimum of two projects and at least **Partially Complete** the remaining project.
  * **Complete** a minimum of four homework assignments and at least **Partially Complete** a minimum of four more.
  * Up to one unexcused lab absence, **Complete** a minimum of seven of the lab assignments, and at least **Partially Complete** a minimum of four more.
  * Schedule and attend at least two Office Hours meetings
* To earn a C in the course, a student will:
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of two exams.
  * One of the following:
    * At least **Partially Complete** all three projects.
	* **Complete** the final project and at least **Partially Complete** one of the first two projects.
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of six homework assignments.
  * Up to two unexcused lab absences, **Complete** at least three of the lab assignments, and at least **Partially Complete** a minimum of six more.
  * Schedule and attend at least one Office Hours meeting
* To earn a D in the course, a student will:
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of two exams.
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of two projects.
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of four homework assignments.
  * Up to three unexcused lab absences and at least **Partially Complete** a minimum of eight lab assignments.

### Revising submitted work
If a submitted assignment receives a **Partial** assessment and the student seeks a **Complete** assessment:
* In most cases, detailed feedback will be provided with requirements necessary for a revision to be considered **Complete**. A deadline will also be established -- typically a week after the assignment is returned.
* If the student has any questions or is uncertain what those requirements are, they should schedule an office hour appointment.
* Individual students can request extensions of their deadlines -- typically, unless the student has abused this throughout the semester, requests will be granted.
* If the student submits revisions which meet the requirements by the deadline, the revised work will receive a **Complete** assessment.

If a submitted assignment receives a **Missing** assessment, a similar list of requirements will be provided. In most cases, a **Missing** assignment can only be upgraded to **Partially Complete**, but the instructor reserves the right to allow students to achieve **Complete** on a case-by-case basis.

## <a name="expectations">Expectations</a>

Although you and I play different roles in the course, we both have
your learning as a common goal. There are things I expect from you as
a student in the course, but there are also things you can expect of
me as the course instructor and facilitator.

If I am not fulfilling my responsibilities outlined below, you are
welcome (and encouraged!) to call me out, perhaps via the anonymous
feedback forms here [Prof. Seme](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScytpXo5uLAoZu_zrVRsL9mbbwSn5PR8izfNBgbgSzO7u6Baw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and [Dr. Yorgey]((https://forms.gle/YhPgQTq1FHiH71B6A)). I will also
initiate a conversation if you are not fulfilling yours. However, none
of us will meet all of the expectations perfectly---me included!---so
it's also important that we have grace and patience with one another.

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

Attendance in this class is not required as part of your grade.
However, I do expect you to attend and appreciate knowing in advance
if you will need to miss class.
<!--
If you have chosen to attend class in person, you are expected to do
so consistently; you may not decide to attend remotely some days just
because you feel like it.  However, there are legitimate reasons
for attending remotely, such as feeling ill or travelling unavoidably.
-->

## <a name="disabilities">Disabilities</a>

If you have a documented disability or some other reason that you
cannot meet the above expectations, and/or your learning would be best
served by a modification to the usual course policies, I would be
happy to work with you—please get in touch (via Teams or email)! The
course policies are just a means to an end; I don't care about the
policies per se but I do care about you and your learning.

*It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with
disabilities, pursuant to federal and state law. Students should
contact Julie Brown in the Office of Academic Success (505.2954;
brownj@hendrix.edu) to begin the accommodation process. Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should
inform the instructor at the beginning of the course.*

## <a name="diversity">Diversity and Inclusion</a>

Hendrix College values a diverse learning environment as outlined in
the College's Statement on Diversity. All members of this community
are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive
environment for every other member of the community. If you believe
you have been the subject of discrimination please contact Dean Mike
Leblanc at [leblanc@hendrix.edu](mailto:leblanc@hendrix.edu) or
501-450-1222 or the Title IX Coordinator Jennifer Fulbright  at
[titleix@hendrix.edu](mailto:titleix@hendrix.edu)or 501-505-2901. If
you have ideas for improving the inclusivity of the classroom
experience please feel free to [contact
me](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScytpXo5uLAoZu_zrVRsL9mbbwSn5PR8izfNBgbgSzO7u6Baw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  For more information on

## <a name="health">Mental and Physical Health</a>

Hendrix recognizes that many students face mental and/or physical
health challenges. If your health status will impact attendance or
assignments, please communicate with me as soon as possible.  If you
would like to implement academic accommodations, contact Julie Brown
in the office of Academic Success
([brownj@hendrix.edu](mailto:brownj@hendrix.edu)).  To maintain
optimal health, please make use of free campus resources like the
[Hendrix Medical Clinic](https://www.hendrix.edu/healthservices/) or
Counseling Services (501.450.1448).  Your health is important, and I
care more about your health and well-being than I do about this class!
