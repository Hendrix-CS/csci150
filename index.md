# Coursework

## <a name="latedays">Late Policy</a>

[*Adapted from Spencer Bagley and David Clark, via [Robert
Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/a-real-world-approach-to-deadlines/)*]

CSCI 150 uses a **real-world policy** on due dates---but this may not
mean what you think!  In the *real* real world, due dates exist but
they are often not ironclad.  The purpose of deadlines is usually to
help motivate you to complete the task, but if you need more time to
get the job done well, you email whoever set the deadline to ask if
you can have more time.  Studies have shown that deadline extension
requests---in moderation and when truly needed---often lead to
*better* employee evaluations (not to mention better work). [*See [Go
Ahead and Ask for More Time on that
Deadline](https://hbr.org/2021/12/go-ahead-and-ask-for-more-time-on-that-deadline)
by Ashley Williams*.]

**If you need an extension on a due date, email me and explain what
you need**, and it will probably be fine.  It helps if you propose a
concrete new deadline (*e.g.* "I can get it done by 5pm on
Wednesday").  If you ask for lots of extensions, we'll work together
to find a way to help you keep up.  Note, however, that late
submissions may not receive feedback as quickly as on-time
submissions.

If you have significant extenuating circumstances that cause you to
miss multiple deadlines, please [come to office
hours](https://byorgey.youcanbook.me) to discuss broader accommodations.  I'm
happy to be flexible, but it helps to know what you need so I can
figure out the best way to help.

## <a name="participation">Course Participation</a>

Each student should schedule and attend at least two office hour
meetings with either their lecture or lab instructor at some point
during the semester.

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**.

On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment.

<!-- On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. Each partner should **submit their own solution** to the assignment. -->

**Lab attendance is required**. Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic Resource Center. Continue through the door at the far end of the hall into the first computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the back.

You will have three projects in this course. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two to three weeks after they are assigned.

**You must work individually on the projects.** You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>

There will be three exams. Each exam will have two parts:
* In-class written part: Analysis and tracing of Python code samples.
* Take-home part: At the end of the written exam will appear some Python coding problems, the solutions to which are to be
submitted by the start of the next class period.

* Exam 1: Monday, September 18, covering functions, math, numerical
  data, and conditionals

  * One of the following:
    * At least **Partially Complete** all three projects.
	* **Complete** the final project and at least **Partially Complete** one of the first two projects.
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of six homework assignments.
  * Up to two unexcused lab absences, **Complete** at least four of the lab assignments, and at least **Partially Complete** a minimum of six more.
  * Schedule and attend at least one Office Hours meeting.
* To earn a D in the course, a student will:
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of two exams.
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of two projects.
  * At least **Partially Complete** a minimum of four homework assignments.
  * Up to three unexcused lab absences and at least **Partially Complete** a minimum of nine lab assignments.

### Revising submitted work
If a submitted assignment receives a **Partial** assessment and the student seeks a **Complete** assessment:
* In most cases, detailed feedback will be provided with requirements necessary for a revision to be considered **Complete**. A deadline will also be established -- typically a week after the assignment is returned.
* If the student has any questions or is uncertain what those requirements are, they should schedule an office hour appointment.
* Individual students can request extensions of their deadlines -- typically, unless the student has abused this throughout the semester, requests will be granted.
* If the student submits revisions which meet the requirements by the deadline, the revised work will receive a **Complete** assessment.

If a submitted assignment receives a **Incomplete** assessment, a similar list of requirements will be provided. In most cases, an **Incomplete** assignment can only be upgraded to **Partially Complete**, but the instructor reserves the right to allow students to achieve **Complete** on a case-by-case basis.

## <a name="expectations">Expectations</a>

Although you and I play different roles in the course, we both have
your learning as a common goal. There are things I expect from you as
a student in the course, but there are also things you can expect of
me as the course instructor and facilitator.

If I am not fulfilling my responsibilities outlined below, you are
welcome (and encouraged!) to call me out, perhaps via the [anonymous
feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecdjyRdCiHkCv5Y5WF09RHLgdf9bl1WoeJQJZmnErPCd8YxA/viewform). I will also
initiate a conversation if you are not fulfilling yours. However, none
of us will meet all of the expectations perfectly---me included!---so
it's also important that we have grace and patience with one another.

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

Attendance in this class is not required as part of your grade.
However, I do expect you to attend and appreciate knowing in advance
if you will need to miss class.

## <a name="disabilities">Disabilities</a>

If you have a documented disability or some other reason that you
cannot meet the above expectations, and/or your learning would be best
served by a modification to the usual course policies, I would be
happy to work with you—please get in touch (via Teams or email)! The
course policies are just a means to an end; I don't care about the
policies per se but I do care about you and your learning.

*It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with
disabilities, pursuant to federal and state law. Students should
contact Julie Brown in the Office of Academic Success (505.2954;
brownj@hendrix.edu) to begin the accommodation process. Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should
inform the instructor at the beginning of the course.*

## <a name="diversity">Diversity and Inclusion</a>

Hendrix College values a diverse learning environment as outlined in
the College's Statement on Diversity. All members of this community
are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive
environment for every other member of the community. If you believe
you have been the subject of discrimination please contact Dean Mike
Leblanc at [leblanc@hendrix.edu](mailto:leblanc@hendrix.edu) or
501-450-1222 or the Title IX Coordinator Jennifer Fulbright at
[titleix@hendrix.edu](mailto:titleix@hendrix.edu) or 501-505-2901. If
you have ideas for improving the inclusivity of the classroom
experience please feel free to [contact

## <a name="health">Mental and Physical Health</a>

Hendrix recognizes that many students face mental and/or physical
health challenges. If your health status will impact attendance or
assignments, please communicate with me as soon as possible.  If you
would like to implement academic accommodations, contact Julie Brown
in the office of Academic Success
