# Coursework

Each student has **four late days** to spend throughout the semester
as they wish.  Simply inform the instructor any time *prior* to the
due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may
then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days
may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days;
turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1
late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment)
and exceptional circumstances (you get sick, travel for a game or
family obligation, *etc.*). After you have used up your late days,
late assignments will receive at most half credit.

There will often be short homework assignments to be completed over
the weekend, assigned on Friday and due Wednesday, sometimes with a
corresponding quiz at the beginning of class on Wednesday.

Homework will generally be turned in electronically [via this Google
form]({{ site.submission }}).

* If you type a homework using something like Word or Pages, you
  should export a PDF (this is typically an option under the "File"
  menu).

* You may also write your homework solutions on physical paper and
  scan them using an app such as [Genius
  Scan](https://thegrizzlylabs.com/genius-scan) which can export your
  document as a PDF.

<!-- ## <a name="participation">Participation</a>: 110 points -->

<!-- Participation points will be assigned as follows: -->

<!-- * Each student is required to have a one-on-one meeting with the -->
<!--   instructor 4 times per semester. Scheduling and following through on -->
<!--   each meeting is worth 10 points/meeting. -->

<!-- * Each student is expected to meet multiple times during each of the -->
<!--   14 lab periods with the instructor and TA. Following through on all -->
<!--   lab meetings for a given lab is worth 5 points. -->

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**. All labs are weighted equally within the lab portion of your final grade.

<!--On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. A partnership should only turn in a **single copy** of the assignment. If students working as partners wish to turn in a lab late, both students must use a late day.-->
On these labs, you will work with a partner on the lab assignments. Their name must be listed on any code you hand in as joint work. Each partner should **submit their own solution** to the assignment.

**Lab attendance is required**. For this semester, labs will meet virtually online in Microsoft Teams. <!--Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic Resource Center. Continue through the door at the far end of the hall into the first computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the back.-->

You will have three projects in this course. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two to three weeks after they are assigned.

**You must work individually on the projects.** You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="exams">Exams</a>: 250 points

There will be three in-class exams, the first worth 50 points and the
second and third worth 100 points. They will consist of short answer
questions along with writing and debugging code.

* Exam 1: Friday, February 12, covering functions, math, numerical
  data, and conditionals ([practice exam](docs/exam1-practice-s21.pdf))
* Exam 2: Monday, March 22, covering input/output, while loops, for
  loops, lists, and strings ([practice exam](docs/exam2-practice-s21.pdf); [practice exam solutions](docs/exam2-practice-solutions-s21.pdf))

## <a name="expectations">Expectations</a>

Although you and I play different roles in the course, we both have
your learning as a common goal. There are things I expect from you as
a student in the course, but there are also things you can expect of
me as the course instructor and facilitator.

If I am not fulfilling my responsibilities outlined below, you are
welcome (and encouraged!) to call me out, perhaps via the [anonymous
feedback form](https://forms.gle/YhPgQTq1FHiH71B6A). I will also
initiate a conversation if you are not fulfilling yours. However, none
of us will meet all of the expectations perfectly---me included!---so
it's also important that we have grace and patience with one another.

          going on that will affect your engagement in the

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

Attendance in this class is not required as part of your grade.
However, I do expect you to attend and appreciate knowing in advance
if you will need to miss class.

If you have chosen to attend class in person, you are expected to do
so consistently; you may not decide to attend remotely some days just
because you feel like it.  However, there are legitimate reasons
for attending remotely, such as feeling ill or travelling unavoidably.

## <a name="disabilities">Disabilities</a>

If you have a documented disability or some other reason that you
cannot meet the above expectations, and/or your learning would be best
served by a modification to the usual course policies, I would be
happy to work with you—please get in touch (via Teams or email)! The
course policies are just a means to an end; I don't care about the
policies per se but I do care about you and your learning.

*It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with
disabilities, pursuant to federal and state law. Students should
contact Julie Brown in the Office of Academic Success (505.2954;
brownj@hendrix.edu) to begin the accommodation process. Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should
inform the instructor at the beginning of the course.*

## <a name="diversity">Diversity and Inclusion</a>

Hendrix College values a diverse learning environment as outlined in
the College's Statement on Diversity. All members of this community
are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive
environment for every other member of the community. If you believe
you have been the subject of discrimination please contact Dean Mike
Leblanc at [leblanc@hendrix.edu](mailto:leblanc@hendrix.edu) or
501-450-1222 or the Title IX Coordinator Allison Vetter at
[titleix@hendrix.edu](mailto:titleix@hendrix.edu)or 501-505-2901. If
you have ideas for improving the inclusivity of the classroom
experience please feel free to [contact
me](https://forms.gle/YhPgQTq1FHiH71B6A).  For more information on
Hendrix non-discrimination policies, visit
[hendrix.edu/nondiscrimination](http://hendrix.edu/nondiscrimination).

## <a name="health">Mental and Physical Health</a>

Hendrix recognizes that many students face mental and/or physical
health challenges. If your health status will impact attendance or
assignments, please communicate with me as soon as possible.  If you
would like to implement academic accommodations, contact Julie Brown
in the office of Academic Success
([brownj@hendrix.edu](mailto:brownj@hendrix.edu)).  To maintain
optimal health, please make use of free campus resources like the
[Hendrix Medical Clinic](https://www.hendrix.edu/healthservices/) or
Counseling Services (501.450.1448).  Your health is important, and I
care more about your health and well-being than I do about this class!
