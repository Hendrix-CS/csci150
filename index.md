# Coursework

## Tokens

Each student begins the semester with **six tokens**. 
* Send Dr. Ferrer a message on Teams to spend a token.
* Students may **spend** tokens as follows:
  * Spend **one** token to submit a revised version of a project, in the event the project was assessed at Level 1.
  * Spend **one** token to retake an attempted quiz or resubmit an attempted homework.
  * Spend **two** tokens to request an extension on an assignment deadline. 
    * When requesting an extension, specify the new deadline that you think will suffice.
    * Most deadline requests will be approved, but the instructor reserves the right to limit extensions if he deems them unreasonable.
  * Spend **three** tokens to take a missed quiz resulting from an **unexcused** absence.
  * Spend **three** tokens to submit an assignment after its deadline (including extended deadlines).
* To earn additional tokens:
  * Earn **one** token by booking and attending an office hours appointment. 
    * A student may earn up to **one token per week** from attending office hours, and a maximum of **six** tokens over the course of 
      the semester.
  * Earn **two** tokens by creating a homework problem to illustrate a concept.
  * Earn **four** tokens by creating a 2-4 minute video educating a viewer about a concept from the course.
* Students may not go into token debt - to spend tokens, a student must have a positive balance.

There will often be short homework assignments to be completed,
typically assigned on Monday and due the following Monday.  Homework 
with coding practice problems will be submitted electronically. 
By-hand homework should be submitted on physical paper at the start 
of class time -- you can write (neatly) or type and print such solutions.

## <a name="quizzes">Quizzes</a>

A short quiz will be given at the end of class on most Wednesdays. Each 
quiz will contain one or more short problems that should be solvable within
10 minutes. 

Quizzes are pass-fail. If a student does not pass a quiz, or does not
attend class on a quiz day for any reason, they can make up the quiz by 
visiting the instructor's office during a scheduled make-up time. The 
schedule will be announced during the second week of classes.

<!--
* Tuesday, February 6, 11:10-12:00
* Tuesday, February 20, 11:10-12:00
* Thursday, February 29, 11:10-12:00
* Thursday, March 28, 11:10-12:00
* Tuesday, April 9, 11:10-12:00 
* Thursday, April 18, 11:10-12:00
-->

Quiz make-ups can also be arranged on Monday, April 29, the Reading Day.

Missing a quiz is **excused** if the student communicates to the instructor
**prior to class that day** that it is necessary for the student to miss class.

If extenuating circumstances make the scheduled make-up times impossible
to attend, a student should communicate with the instructor to determine
other potential arrangements.

Much of your experience with programming in this course will be through weekly labs. Each lab will be assigned in lab with time allotted to work through the materials, and will be due **by the start of the following lab**.

Each lab consists of a series of milestones. At the start of each lab, you will receive a sheet of paper listing the 
milestones for that lab. As you achieve each milestone, you will demonstrate to the instructor or TA that you have met the
milestone, and they will record this achievement on your checklist. When you complete all of the lab milestones, you will 
submit the milestone checklist.

If you complete the lab during the lab period, hand your checklist to your lab instructor before you leave the lab. If you
require additional time beyond the lab period to complete the lab, either the instructor or the lab TA can check off the
remaining milestones during office hours. You can then submit the completed checklist to the instructor at the start of 
the next lab.

You will work with a partner on each lab assignment. Each partner will have their own milestone checklist. If they do not 
complete the milestones during the lab period, they should find time outside of lab to work together to complete them. If 
they are unable to do so, only the instructor is authorized to record milestones for students working alone.

**Lab attendance is required**. If an extenuating circumstance impedes the attendance of lab, the student must contact
the lab instructor **prior to the start of the lab** for the absence to be **excused**. The student is still responsible
for completing the lab activity on-time.

Labs take place in the **Snoddy Computer Lab**, in the Bailey Library. As you go through the exterior door of the library, turn immediately to your left and enter the Snoddy Academic Resource Center. Continue through the door at the far end of the hall into the first computer lab, and then enter the second lab at the back.

You will have three projects in this course. These projects will cover concepts we have discussed in class and in labs, and will be due approximately two to four weeks after they are assigned.

**You must work individually on the projects.** You may discuss concepts and ideas with your classmates, but the code you turn in must be your own. You will be graded not only on correctness, but also technique, documentation and evaluation of your solution. Further details on the grading standards and handin instructions for each project will be given when they are assigned.

## <a name="expectations">Expectations</a>

Although you and I play different roles in the course, we both have
your learning as a common goal. There are things I expect from you as
a student in the course, but there are also things you can expect of
me as the course instructor and facilitator.
<!--
If I am not fulfilling my responsibilities outlined below, you are
welcome (and encouraged!) to call me out, perhaps via the [anonymous
feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecdjyRdCiHkCv5Y5WF09RHLgdf9bl1WoeJQJZmnErPCd8YxA/viewform). I will also
initiate a conversation if you are not fulfilling yours. However, none
of us will meet all of the expectations perfectly---me included!---so
it's also important that we have grace and patience with one another.

## <a name="attendance">Attendance</a>

Attendance in this class is not required as part of your grade.
However, I do expect you to attend and appreciate knowing in advance
if you will need to miss class.

## <a name="disabilities">Disabilities</a>

If you have a documented disability or some other reason that you
cannot meet the above expectations, and/or your learning would be best
served by a modification to the usual course policies, I would be
happy to work with you—please get in touch (via Teams or email)! The
course policies are just a means to an end; I don't care about the
policies per se but I do care about you and your learning.

*It is the policy of Hendrix College to accommodate students with
disabilities, pursuant to federal and state law. Students should
contact Julie Brown in the Office of Academic Success (505.2954;
brownj@hendrix.edu) to begin the accommodation process. Any student
seeking accommodation in relation to a recognized disability should
inform the instructor at the beginning of the course.*

Hendrix College values a diverse learning environment as outlined in
the College's Statement on Diversity. All members of this community
are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive
environment for every other member of the community. If you believe
you have been the subject of discrimination please contact Dean Mike
Leblanc at [leblanc@hendrix.edu](mailto:leblanc@hendrix.edu) or

you have ideas for improving the inclusivity of the classroom
experience please feel free to [contact

Hendrix recognizes that many students face mental and/or physical
health challenges. If your health status will impact attendance or
assignments, please communicate with me as soon as possible.  If you
would like to implement academic accommodations, contact Julie Brown
