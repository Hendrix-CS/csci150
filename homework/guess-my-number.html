<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - HW 4<br>Guess My Number</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The purpose of this assignment is to practice the use
of <tt>while</tt> loops in getting the computer to successfully play a
simple game.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In class, we wrote a program that allowed a human to play a game of
  Guess My Number: the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and
  100, and the human then repeatedly guesses numbers, with the
  computer responding with "too small" or "too big" until the human
  guesses correctly. (The code written in
  the <a href="../lectures/8am/guess_number.py">8am section can be found
  here</a>.)</p>

<p>Your assignment is to write a program that makes
  the <em>computer</em> play Guess My Number.  That is,
  the <em>human</em> should pick a number between 1 and 100, and the
  computer will repeatedly guess numbers, with the human telling it
  "too small" or "too big" until the computer guesses correctly.</p>

<p>For example, the output of your program might look something like
  this:</p>

<p><pre>
Is your number 50? too big
Is your number 25? too small
Is your number 32? too small
Is your number 40? yes
Woohoo! I win!
  </pre>
</p>

Remember that you should put all your code inside function
definitions, with a single call to a <tt>main()</tt> function as the
last thing in the file.

<h2>Things to think about</h2>

<p>Some extra things to think about, once you have a basic version
working.  You are not required to think about these to receive full
  credit on the assignment, but you may enjoy thinking about them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can your program detect when the human is cheating?</li>
  <li>How many guesses does your program need before guessing
  correctly? How can you make this number as small as possible?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>

Put your program in a Python file named <tt>guess.py</tt> and turn it in
via Moodle.  <b>You must turn in your assignment by 4pm on
  Monday, September 28.</b>
