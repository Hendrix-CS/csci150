<h2>Section 1</h2>

<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now I want to begin to fulfill a certain

obligation by stating that there was one person, no longer here, who had something to say,

and who said it, but whom no one believed or really understood. Forgotten. For reasons

that will become apparent I&#146;d prefer that he remain forgotten, but there&#146;s no

choice other than to reopen his case.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I don&#146;t know his whole story. No one ever

will, except Phaedrus himself, and he can no longer speak. But from his writings and from

what others have said and from fragments of my own recall it should be possible to piece

together some kind of approximation of what he was talking about. Since the basic ideas

for this Chautauqua were taken from him there will be no real deviation, only an

enlargement that may make the Chautauqua more understandable than if it were presented in

a purely abstract way. The purpose of the enlargement is not to argue for him, certainly

not to praise him. The purpose is to bury him...forever.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Back in Minnesota when we were traveling through

some marshland I did some talking about the &quot;shapes&quot; of technology, the

&quot;death force&quot; that the Sutherlands seem to be running from. I want to move now

in the opposite direction from the Sutherlands, toward that force and into its center. In

doing so we will be entering Phaedrus&#146; world, the only world he ever knew, in which

all understanding is in terms of underlying form.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The world of underlying form is an unusual object

of discussion because it is actually a mode of discussion itself. You discuss things in

terms of their immediate appearance or you discuss them in terms of their underlying form,

and when you try to discuss these modes of discussion you get involved in what could be

called a platform problem. You have no platform from which to discuss them other than the

modes themselves.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Previously I was discussing his world of

underlying form, or at least the aspect of it called technology, from an external view.

Now I think it&#146;s right to talk about that world of underlying form from its own point

of view. I want to talk about the underlying form of the world of underlying form itself.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To do this, first of all, a dichotomy is

necessary, but before I can use it honestly I have to back up and say what it is and

means, and that is a long story in itself. Part of this back-up problem. But right now I

just want to use a dichotomy and explain it later. I want to divide human understanding

into two kinds...classical understanding and romantic understanding. In terms of ultimate

truth a dichotomy of this sort has little meaning but it is quite legitimate when one is

operating within the classic mode used to discover or create a world of underlying form.

The terms classic and romantic, as Phaedrus used them, mean the following:</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A classical understanding sees the world primarily

as underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of

immediate appearance. If you were to show an engine or a mechanical drawing or electronic

schematic to a romantic it is unlikely he would see much of interest in it. It has no

appeal because the reality he sees is its surface. Dull, complex lists of names, lines and

numbers. Nothing interesting. But if you were to show the same blueprint or schematic or

give the same description to a classical person he might look at it and then become

fascinated by it because he sees that within the lines and shapes and symbols is a

tremendous richness of underlying form.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The romantic mode is primarily inspirational,

imaginative, creative, intuitive. Feelings rather than facts predominate. &quot;Art&quot;

when it is opposed to &quot;Science&quot; is often romantic. It does not proceed by reason

or by laws. It proceeds by feeling, intuition and esthetic conscience. In the northern

European cultures the romantic mode is usually associated with femininity, but this is

certainly not a necessary association.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The classic mode, by contrast, proceeds by reason

and by laws...which are themselves underlying forms of thought and behavior. In the

European cultures it is primarily a masculine mode and the fields of science, law and

medicine are unattractive to women largely for this reason. Although motorcycle riding is

romantic, motorcycle maintenance is purely classic. The dirt, the grease, the mastery of

underlying form required all give it such a negative romantic appeal that women never go

near it.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Although surface ugliness is often found in the

classic mode of understanding it is not inherent in it. There is a classic esthetic which

romantics often miss because of its subtlety. The classic style is straightforward,

unadorned, unemotional, economical and carefully proportioned. Its purpose is not to

inspire emotionally, but to bring order out of chaos and make the unknown known. It is not

an esthet- ically free and natural style. It is esthetically restrained. Everything is

under control. Its value is measured in terms of the skill with which this control is

maintained.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To a romantic this classic mode often appears

dull, awkward and ugly, like mechanical maintenance itself. Everything is in terms of

pieces and parts and components and relationships. Nothing is figured out until it&#146;s

run through the computer a dozen times. Everything&#146;s got to be measured and proved.

Oppressive. Heavy. Endlessly grey. The death force.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Within the classic mode, however, the romantic has

some appearances of his own. Frivolous, irrational, erratic, untrustworthy, interested

primarily in pleasure-seeking. Shallow. Of no substance. Often a parasite who cannot or

will not carry his own weight. A real drag on society. By now these battle lines should

sound a little familiar.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This is the source of the trouble. Persons tend to

think and feel exclusively in one mode or the other and in doing so tend to misunderstand

and underestimate what the other mode is all about. But no one is willing to give up the

truth as he sees it, and as far as I know, no one now living has any real reconciliation

of these truths or modes. There is no point at which these visions of reality are unified.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And so in recent times we have seen a huge split

develop between a classic culture and a romantic counterculture...two worlds growingly

alienated and hateful toward each other with everyone wondering if it will always be this

way, a house divided against itself. No one wants it really...despite what his antagonists

in the other dimension might think.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It is within this context that what Phaedrus

thought and said is significant. But no one was listening at that time and they only

thought him eccentric at first, then undesirable, then slightly mad, and then genuinely

insane. There seems little doubt that he was insane, but much of his writing at the time

indicates that what was driving him insane was this hostile opinion of him. Unusual

behavior tends to produce estrangement in others which tends to further the unusual

behavior and thus the estrangement in self-stoking cycles until some sort of climax is

reached. In Phaedrus&#146; case there was a court-ordered police arrest and permanent

removal from society.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I see we are at the left turn onto US 12 and John

has pulled up for gas. I pull up beside him.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The thermometer by the door of the station reads

92 degrees. &quot;Going to be another rough one today,&quot; I say.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">When the tanks are filled we head across the

street into a restaurant for coffee. Chris, of course, is hungry.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I tell him I&#146;ve been waiting for that. I tell

him he eats with the rest of us or not all. Not angrily. Just matter-of-factly. He&#146;s

reproachful but sees how it&#146;s going to be.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I catch a fleeting look of relief from Sylvia.

Evidently she thought this was going to be a continuous problem.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">When we have finished the coffee and are outside

again the heat is so ferocious we move off on the cycles as fast as possible. Again there

is that momentary coolness, but it disappears. The sun makes the burned grass and sand so

bright I have to squint to cut down glare. This US 12 is old, bad highway. The broken

concrete is tar-patched and bumpy. Road signs indicate detours ahead. On either side of

the road are occasional worn sheds and shacks and roadside stands that have accumulated

through the years. The traffic is heavy now. I&#146;m just as happy to be thinking about

the rational, analytical, classical world of Phaedrus.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">His kind of rationality has been used since

antiquity to remove oneself from the tedium and depression of one&#146;s immediate

surroundings. What makes it hard to see is that where once it was used to get away from it

all, the escape has been so successful that now it is the &quot;it all&quot; that the

romantics are trying to escape. What makes his world so hard to see clearly is not its

strangeness but its usualness. Familiarity can blind you too.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">His way of looking at things produces a kind of

description that can be called an &quot;analytic&quot; description. That is another name

of the classic platform from which one discusses things in terms of their underlying form.

He was a totally classic person. And to give a fuller description of what this is I want

now to turn his analytic approach back upon itself...to analyze analysis itself. I want to

do this first of all by giving an extensive example of it and then by dissecting what it

is. The motorcycle is a perfect subject for it since the motorcycle itself was invented by

classic minds. So listen:</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A motorcycle may be divided for purposes of

classical rational analysis by means of its component assemblies and by means of its

functions.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">If divided by means of its component assemblies,

its most basic division is into a power assembly and a running assembly.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The power assembly may be divided into the engine

and the power-delivery system. The engine will be taken up first.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The engine consists of a housing containing a

power train, a fuel-air system, an ignition system, a feedback system and a lubrication

system.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The power train consists of cylinders, pistons,

connecting rods, a crankshaft and a flywheel.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The fuel-air system components, which are part of

the engine, consist of a gas tank and filter, an air cleaner, a carburetor, valves and

exhaust pipes.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The ignition system consists of an alternator, a

rectifier, a battery, a high-voltage coil and spark plugs.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The feedback system consists of a cam chain, a

camshaft, tappets and a distributor.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The lubrication system consists of an oil pump and

channels throughout the housing for distribution of the oil.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The power-delivery system accompanying the engine

consists of a clutch, a transmission and a chain.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The supporting assembly accompanying the power

assembly consists of a frame, including foot pegs, seat and fenders; a steering assembly;

front and rear shock absorbers; wheels; control levers and cables; lights and horn; and

speed and mileage indicators.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">That&#146;s a motorcycle divided according to its

components. To know what the components are for, a division according to functions is

necessary:</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A motorcycle may be divided into normal running

functions and special, operator-controlled functions.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Normal running functions may be divided into

functions during the intake cycle, functions during the compression cycle, functions

during the power cycle and functions during the exhaust cycle.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And so on. I could go on about which functions

occur in their proper sequence during each of the four cycles, then go on to the

operator-controlled functions and that would be a very summary description of the

underlying form of a motorcycle. It would be extremely short and rudimentary, as

descriptions of this sort go. Almost any one of the components mentioned can be expanded

on indefinitely. I&#146;ve read an entire engineering volume on contact points alone,

which are just a small but vital part of the distributor. There are other types of engines

than the single-cylinder Otto engine described here: two-cycle engines, multiple-cylinder

engines, diesel engines, Wankel engines...but this example is enough.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This description would cover the &quot;what&quot;

of the motorcycle in terms of components, and the &quot;how&quot; of the engine in terms

of functions. It would badly need a &quot;where&quot; analysis in the form of an

illustration, and also a &quot;why&quot; analysis in the form of engineering principles

that led to this particular conformation of parts. But the purpose here isn&#146;t

exhaustively to analyze the motorcycle. It&#146;s to provide a starting point, an example

of a mode of understanding of things which will itself become an object of analysis.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">There&#146;s certainly nothing strange about this

description at first hearing. It sounds like something from a beginning textbook on the

subject, or perhaps a first lesson in a vocational course. What is unusual about it is

seen when it ceases to be a mode of discourse and becomes an object of discourse. Then

certain things can be pointed to.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The first thing to be observed about this

description is so obvious you have to hold it down or it will drown out every other

observation. This is: It is just duller than ditchwater. Yah-da, yah-da, yah-da, yah-da,

yah, carburetor, gear ratio, compression, yah-da-yah, piston, plugs, intake, yah-da-yah,

on and on and on. That is the romantic face of the classic mode. Dull, awkward and ugly.

Few romantics get beyond that point.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But if you can hold down that most obvious

observation, some other things can be noticed that do not at first appear.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The first is that the motorcycle, so described, is

almost impossible to understand unless you already know how one works. The immediate

surface impressions that are essential for primary understanding are gone. Only the

underlying form is left.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The second is that the observer is missing. The

description doesn&#146;t say that to see the piston you must remove the cylinder head.

&quot;You&quot; aren&#146;t anywhere in the picture. Even the &quot;operator&quot; is a

kind of personalityless robot whose performance of a function on the machine is completely

mechanical. There are no real subjects in this description. Only objects exist that are

independent of any observer.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The third is that the words &quot;good&quot; and

&quot;bad&quot; and all their synonyms are completely absent. No value judgments have been

expressed anywhere, only facts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The fourth is that there is a knife moving here. A

very deadly one; an intellectual scalpel so swift and so sharp you sometimes don&#146;t

see it moving. You get the illusion that all those parts are just there and are being

named as they exist. But they can be named quite differently and organized quite

differently depending on how the knife moves.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">For example, the feedback mechanism which includes

the camshaft and cam chain and tappets and distributor exists only because of an unusual

cut of this analytic knife. If you were to go to a motorcycle-parts department and ask

them for a feedback assembly they wouldn&#146;t know what the hell you were talking about.

They don&#146;t split it up that way. No two manufacturers ever split it up quite the same

way and every mechanic is familiar with the problem of the part you can&#146;t buy because

you can&#146;t find it because the manufacturer considers it a part of something else.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It is important to see this knife for what it is

and not to be fooled into thinking that motorcycles or anything else are the way they are

just because the knife happened to cut it up that way. It is important to concentrate on

the knife itself. Later I will want to show how an ability to use this knife creatively

and effectively can result in solutions to the classic and romantic split.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Phaedrus was a master with this knife, and used it

with dexterity and a sense of power. With a single stroke of analytic thought he split the

whole world into parts of his own choosing, split the parts and split the fragments of the

parts, finer and finer and finer until he had reduced it to what he wanted it to be. Even

the special use of the terms &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;romantic&quot; are examples of

his knifemanship.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But if this were all there were to him, analytic

skill, I would be more than willing to shut up about him. What makes it important not to

shut up about him was that he used this skill in such a bizarre and yet meaningful way. No

one ever saw this, I don&#146;t think he even saw it himself, and it may be an illusion of

my own, but the knife he used was less that of an assassin than that of a poor surgeon.

Perhaps there is no difference. But he saw a sick and ailing thing happening and he

started cutting deep, deeper and deeper to get at the root of it. He was after something.

That is important. He was after something and he used the knife because that was the only

tool he had. But he took on so much and went so far in the end his real victim was

himself.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Precision instruments are designed to achieve an

idea, dimensional precision, whose perfection is impossible. There is no perfectly shaped

part of the motorcycle and never will be, but when you come as close as these instruments

take you, remarkable things happen, and you go flying across the countryside under a power

that would be called magic if it were not so completely rational in every way. It&#146;s

the understanding of this rational intellectual idea that&#146;s fundamental. John looks

at the motorcycle and he sees steel in various shapes and has negative feelings about

these steel shapes and turns off the whole thing. I look at the shapes of the steel now

and I see ideas. He thinks I&#146;m working on parts.I &#145;m working on concepts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I was talking about these concepts yesterday when

I said that a motorcycle can be divided according to its components and according to its

functions. When I said that suddenly I created a set of boxes with the following

arrangement:</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><img src="../images/zen1.png" /></p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And when I said the components may be subdivided

into a power assembly and a running assembly, suddenly appear some more little boxes:</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><img src="../images/zen2.png" /></p>





<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And you see that every time I made a further

division, up came more boxes based on these divisions until I had a huge pyramid of boxes.

Finally you see that while I was splitting the cycle up into finer and finer pieces, I was

also building a structure.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This structure of concepts is formally called a

hierarchy and since ancient times has been a basic structure for all Western knowledge.

Kingdoms, empires, churches, armies have all been structured into hierarchies. Modern

businesses are so structured. Tables of contents of reference material are so structured,

mechanical assemblies, computer software, all scientific and technical knowledge is so

structured...so much so that in some fields such as biology, the hierarchy of kingdom-phylum-class-order-family-genus-species is almost

an icon.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The box &quot;motorcycle&quot; contains the boxes

&quot;components&quot; and &quot;functions.&quot; The box &quot;components&quot; contains

the boxes &quot;power assembly&quot; and &quot;running assembly,&quot; and so on. There

are many other kinds of structures produced by other operators such as &quot;causes&quot;

which produce long chain structures of the form, &quot;A causes B which causes C which

causes D,&quot; and so on. A functional description of the motorcycle uses this structure.

The operator&#146;s &quot;exists,&quot; &quot;equals,&quot; and &quot;implies&quot;

produce still other structures. These structures are normally interrelated in patterns and

paths so complex and so enormous no one person can understand more than a small part of

them in his lifetime. The overall name of these interrelated structures, the genus of

which the hierarchy of containment and structure of causation are just species, is system.

The motorcycle is a system. A real system.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To speak of certain government and establishment

institutions as &quot;the system&quot; is to speak correctly, since these organizations

are founded upon the same structural conceptual relationships as a motorcycle. They are

sustained by structural relationships even when they have lost all other meaning and

purpose. People arrive at a factory and perform a totally meaningless task from eight to

five without question because the structure demands that it be that way. There&#146;s no

villain, no &quot;mean guy&quot; who wants them to live meaningless lives, it&#146;s just

that the structure, the system demands it and no one is willing to take on the formidable

task of changing the structure just because it is meaningless.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a

government or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack effects

rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is possible.

The true system, the real system, is our present construction of systematic thought

itself, rationality itself, and if a factory is torn down but the rationality which

produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory.

If a revolution destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought

that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves

in the succeeding government. There&#146;s so much talk about the system. And so little

understanding.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">That&#146;s all the motorcycle is, a system of

concepts worked out in steel. There&#146;s no part in it, no shape in it, that is not out

of someone&#146;s mind&#151;number three tappet is right on too. One more to go. This had

better be it -- .I&#146;ve noticed that people who have never worked with steel have

trouble seeing this...that the motorcycle is primarily a mental phenomenon. They associate

metal with given shapes...pipes, rods, girders, tools, parts...all of them fixed and

inviolable, and think of it as primarily physical. But a person who does machining or

foundry work or forge work or welding sees &quot;steel&quot; as having no shape at all.

Steel can be any shape you want if you are skilled enough, and any shape but the one you

want if you are not. Shapes, like this tappet, are what you arrive at, what you give to

the steel. Steel has no more shape than this old pile of dirt on the engine here. These

shapes are all out of someone&#146;s mind. That&#146;s important to see. The steel? Hell,

even the steel is out of someone&#146;s mind. There&#146;s no steel in nature. Anyone from

the Bronze Age could have told you that. All nature has is a potential for steel.

There&#146;s nothing else there. But what&#146;s &quot;potential&quot;? That&#146;s also

in someone&#146;s mind! -- Ghosts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">That&#146;s really what Phaedrus was talking about

when he said it&#146;s all in the mind. It sounds insane when you just jump up and say it

without reference to anything specific like an engine. But when you tie it down to

something specific and concrete, the insane sound tends to disappear and you see he could

have been saying something of importance.</font></p>
