<h2>Section 1</h2>

<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now I want to begin to fulfill a certain

obligation by stating that there was one person, no longer here, who had something to say,

and who said it, but whom no one believed or really understood. Forgotten. For reasons

that will become apparent I&#146;d prefer that he remain forgotten, but there&#146;s no

choice other than to reopen his case.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I don&#146;t know his whole story. No one ever

will, except Phaedrus himself, and he can no longer speak. But from his writings and from

what others have said and from fragments of my own recall it should be possible to piece

together some kind of approximation of what he was talking about. Since the basic ideas

for this Chautauqua were taken from him there will be no real deviation, only an

enlargement that may make the Chautauqua more understandable than if it were presented in

a purely abstract way. The purpose of the enlargement is not to argue for him, certainly

not to praise him. The purpose is to bury him...forever.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Back in Minnesota when we were traveling through

some marshland I did some talking about the &quot;shapes&quot; of technology, the

&quot;death force&quot; that the Sutherlands seem to be running from. I want to move now

in the opposite direction from the Sutherlands, toward that force and into its center. In

doing so we will be entering Phaedrus&#146; world, the only world he ever knew, in which

all understanding is in terms of underlying form.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The world of underlying form is an unusual object

of discussion because it is actually a mode of discussion itself. You discuss things in

terms of their immediate appearance or you discuss them in terms of their underlying form,

and when you try to discuss these modes of discussion you get involved in what could be

called a platform problem. You have no platform from which to discuss them other than the

modes themselves.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Previously I was discussing his world of

underlying form, or at least the aspect of it called technology, from an external view.

Now I think it&#146;s right to talk about that world of underlying form from its own point

of view. I want to talk about the underlying form of the world of underlying form itself.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To do this, first of all, a dichotomy is

necessary, but before I can use it honestly I have to back up and say what it is and

means, and that is a long story in itself. Part of this back-up problem. But right now I

just want to use a dichotomy and explain it later. I want to divide human understanding

into two kinds...classical understanding and romantic understanding. In terms of ultimate

truth a dichotomy of this sort has little meaning but it is quite legitimate when one is

operating within the classic mode used to discover or create a world of underlying form.

The terms classic and romantic, as Phaedrus used them, mean the following:</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A classical understanding sees the world primarily

as underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of

immediate appearance. If you were to show an engine or a mechanical drawing or electronic

schematic to a romantic it is unlikely he would see much of interest in it. It has no

appeal because the reality he sees is its surface. Dull, complex lists of names, lines and

numbers. Nothing interesting. But if you were to show the same blueprint or schematic or

give the same description to a classical person he might look at it and then become

fascinated by it because he sees that within the lines and shapes and symbols is a

tremendous richness of underlying form.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The romantic mode is primarily inspirational,

imaginative, creative, intuitive. Feelings rather than facts predominate. &quot;Art&quot;

when it is opposed to &quot;Science&quot; is often romantic. It does not proceed by reason

or by laws. It proceeds by feeling, intuition and esthetic conscience. In the northern

European cultures the romantic mode is usually associated with femininity, but this is

certainly not a necessary association.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The classic mode, by contrast, proceeds by reason

and by laws...which are themselves underlying forms of thought and behavior. In the

European cultures it is primarily a masculine mode and the fields of science, law and

medicine are unattractive to women largely for this reason. Although motorcycle riding is

romantic, motorcycle maintenance is purely classic. The dirt, the grease, the mastery of

underlying form required all give it such a negative romantic appeal that women never go

near it.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Although surface ugliness is often found in the

classic mode of understanding it is not inherent in it. There is a classic esthetic which

romantics often miss because of its subtlety. The classic style is straightforward,

unadorned, unemotional, economical and carefully proportioned. Its purpose is not to

inspire emotionally, but to bring order out of chaos and make the unknown known. It is not

an esthet- ically free and natural style. It is esthetically restrained. Everything is

under control. Its value is measured in terms of the skill with which this control is

maintained.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To a romantic this classic mode often appears

dull, awkward and ugly, like mechanical maintenance itself. Everything is in terms of

pieces and parts and components and relationships. Nothing is figured out until it&#146;s

run through the computer a dozen times. Everything&#146;s got to be measured and proved.

Oppressive. Heavy. Endlessly grey. The death force.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Within the classic mode, however, the romantic has

some appearances of his own. Frivolous, irrational, erratic, untrustworthy, interested

primarily in pleasure-seeking. Shallow. Of no substance. Often a parasite who cannot or

will not carry his own weight. A real drag on society. By now these battle lines should

sound a little familiar.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This is the source of the trouble. Persons tend to

think and feel exclusively in one mode or the other and in doing so tend to misunderstand

and underestimate what the other mode is all about. But no one is willing to give up the

truth as he sees it, and as far as I know, no one now living has any real reconciliation

of these truths or modes. There is no point at which these visions of reality are unified.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And so in recent times we have seen a huge split

develop between a classic culture and a romantic counterculture...two worlds growingly

alienated and hateful toward each other with everyone wondering if it will always be this

way, a house divided against itself. No one wants it really...despite what his antagonists

in the other dimension might think.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It is within this context that what Phaedrus

thought and said is significant. But no one was listening at that time and they only

thought him eccentric at first, then undesirable, then slightly mad, and then genuinely

insane. There seems little doubt that he was insane, but much of his writing at the time

indicates that what was driving him insane was this hostile opinion of him. Unusual

behavior tends to produce estrangement in others which tends to further the unusual

behavior and thus the estrangement in self-stoking cycles until some sort of climax is

reached. In Phaedrus&#146; case there was a court-ordered police arrest and permanent

removal from society.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I see we are at the left turn onto US 12 and John

has pulled up for gas. I pull up beside him.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The thermometer by the door of the station reads

92 degrees. &quot;Going to be another rough one today,&quot; I say.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">When the tanks are filled we head across the

street into a restaurant for coffee. Chris, of course, is hungry.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I tell him I&#146;ve been waiting for that. I tell

him he eats with the rest of us or not all. Not angrily. Just matter-of-factly. He&#146;s

reproachful but sees how it&#146;s going to be.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I catch a fleeting look of relief from Sylvia.

Evidently she thought this was going to be a continuous problem.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">When we have finished the coffee and are outside

again the heat is so ferocious we move off on the cycles as fast as possible. Again there

is that momentary coolness, but it disappears. The sun makes the burned grass and sand so

bright I have to squint to cut down glare. This US 12 is old, bad highway. The broken

concrete is tar-patched and bumpy. Road signs indicate detours ahead. On either side of

the road are occasional worn sheds and shacks and roadside stands that have accumulated

through the years. The traffic is heavy now. I&#146;m just as happy to be thinking about

the rational, analytical, classical world of Phaedrus.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">His kind of rationality has been used since

antiquity to remove oneself from the tedium and depression of one&#146;s immediate

surroundings. What makes it hard to see is that where once it was used to get away from it

all, the escape has been so successful that now it is the &quot;it all&quot; that the

romantics are trying to escape. What makes his world so hard to see clearly is not its

strangeness but its usualness. Familiarity can blind you too.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">His way of looking at things produces a kind of

description that can be called an &quot;analytic&quot; description. That is another name

of the classic platform from which one discusses things in terms of their underlying form.

He was a totally classic person. And to give a fuller description of what this is I want

now to turn his analytic approach back upon itself...to analyze analysis itself. I want to

do this first of all by giving an extensive example of it and then by dissecting what it

is. The motorcycle is a perfect subject for it since the motorcycle itself was invented by

classic minds. So listen:</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A motorcycle may be divided for purposes of

classical rational analysis by means of its component assemblies and by means of its

functions.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">If divided by means of its component assemblies,

its most basic division is into a power assembly and a running assembly.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The power assembly may be divided into the engine

and the power-delivery system. The engine will be taken up first.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The engine consists of a housing containing a

power train, a fuel-air system, an ignition system, a feedback system and a lubrication

system.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The power train consists of cylinders, pistons,

connecting rods, a crankshaft and a flywheel.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The fuel-air system components, which are part of

the engine, consist of a gas tank and filter, an air cleaner, a carburetor, valves and

exhaust pipes.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The ignition system consists of an alternator, a

rectifier, a battery, a high-voltage coil and spark plugs.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The feedback system consists of a cam chain, a

camshaft, tappets and a distributor.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The lubrication system consists of an oil pump and

channels throughout the housing for distribution of the oil.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The power-delivery system accompanying the engine

consists of a clutch, a transmission and a chain.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The supporting assembly accompanying the power

assembly consists of a frame, including foot pegs, seat and fenders; a steering assembly;

front and rear shock absorbers; wheels; control levers and cables; lights and horn; and

speed and mileage indicators.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">That&#146;s a motorcycle divided according to its

components. To know what the components are for, a division according to functions is

necessary:</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A motorcycle may be divided into normal running

functions and special, operator-controlled functions.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Normal running functions may be divided into

functions during the intake cycle, functions during the compression cycle, functions

during the power cycle and functions during the exhaust cycle.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And so on. I could go on about which functions

occur in their proper sequence during each of the four cycles, then go on to the

operator-controlled functions and that would be a very summary description of the

underlying form of a motorcycle. It would be extremely short and rudimentary, as

descriptions of this sort go. Almost any one of the components mentioned can be expanded

on indefinitely. I&#146;ve read an entire engineering volume on contact points alone,

which are just a small but vital part of the distributor. There are other types of engines

than the single-cylinder Otto engine described here: two-cycle engines, multiple-cylinder

engines, diesel engines, Wankel engines...but this example is enough.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This description would cover the &quot;what&quot;

of the motorcycle in terms of components, and the &quot;how&quot; of the engine in terms

of functions. It would badly need a &quot;where&quot; analysis in the form of an

illustration, and also a &quot;why&quot; analysis in the form of engineering principles

that led to this particular conformation of parts. But the purpose here isn&#146;t

exhaustively to analyze the motorcycle. It&#146;s to provide a starting point, an example

of a mode of understanding of things which will itself become an object of analysis.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">There&#146;s certainly nothing strange about this

description at first hearing. It sounds like something from a beginning textbook on the

subject, or perhaps a first lesson in a vocational course. What is unusual about it is

seen when it ceases to be a mode of discourse and becomes an object of discourse. Then

certain things can be pointed to.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The first thing to be observed about this

description is so obvious you have to hold it down or it will drown out every other

observation. This is: It is just duller than ditchwater. Yah-da, yah-da, yah-da, yah-da,

yah, carburetor, gear ratio, compression, yah-da-yah, piston, plugs, intake, yah-da-yah,

on and on and on. That is the romantic face of the classic mode. Dull, awkward and ugly.

Few romantics get beyond that point.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But if you can hold down that most obvious

observation, some other things can be noticed that do not at first appear.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The first is that the motorcycle, so described, is

almost impossible to understand unless you already know how one works. The immediate

surface impressions that are essential for primary understanding are gone. Only the

underlying form is left.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The second is that the observer is missing. The

description doesn&#146;t say that to see the piston you must remove the cylinder head.

&quot;You&quot; aren&#146;t anywhere in the picture. Even the &quot;operator&quot; is a

kind of personalityless robot whose performance of a function on the machine is completely

mechanical. There are no real subjects in this description. Only objects exist that are

independent of any observer.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The third is that the words &quot;good&quot; and

&quot;bad&quot; and all their synonyms are completely absent. No value judgments have been

expressed anywhere, only facts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The fourth is that there is a knife moving here. A

very deadly one; an intellectual scalpel so swift and so sharp you sometimes don&#146;t

see it moving. You get the illusion that all those parts are just there and are being

named as they exist. But they can be named quite differently and organized quite

differently depending on how the knife moves.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">For example, the feedback mechanism which includes

the camshaft and cam chain and tappets and distributor exists only because of an unusual

cut of this analytic knife. If you were to go to a motorcycle-parts department and ask

them for a feedback assembly they wouldn&#146;t know what the hell you were talking about.

They don&#146;t split it up that way. No two manufacturers ever split it up quite the same

way and every mechanic is familiar with the problem of the part you can&#146;t buy because

you can&#146;t find it because the manufacturer considers it a part of something else.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It is important to see this knife for what it is

and not to be fooled into thinking that motorcycles or anything else are the way they are

just because the knife happened to cut it up that way. It is important to concentrate on

the knife itself. Later I will want to show how an ability to use this knife creatively

and effectively can result in solutions to the classic and romantic split.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Phaedrus was a master with this knife, and used it

with dexterity and a sense of power. With a single stroke of analytic thought he split the

whole world into parts of his own choosing, split the parts and split the fragments of the

parts, finer and finer and finer until he had reduced it to what he wanted it to be. Even

the special use of the terms &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;romantic&quot; are examples of

his knifemanship.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But if this were all there were to him, analytic

skill, I would be more than willing to shut up about him. What makes it important not to

shut up about him was that he used this skill in such a bizarre and yet meaningful way. No

one ever saw this, I don&#146;t think he even saw it himself, and it may be an illusion of

my own, but the knife he used was less that of an assassin than that of a poor surgeon.

Perhaps there is no difference. But he saw a sick and ailing thing happening and he

started cutting deep, deeper and deeper to get at the root of it. He was after something.

That is important. He was after something and he used the knife because that was the only

tool he had. But he took on so much and went so far in the end his real victim was

himself.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Precision instruments are designed to achieve an

idea, dimensional precision, whose perfection is impossible. There is no perfectly shaped

part of the motorcycle and never will be, but when you come as close as these instruments

take you, remarkable things happen, and you go flying across the countryside under a power

that would be called magic if it were not so completely rational in every way. It&#146;s

the understanding of this rational intellectual idea that&#146;s fundamental. John looks

at the motorcycle and he sees steel in various shapes and has negative feelings about

these steel shapes and turns off the whole thing. I look at the shapes of the steel now

and I see ideas. He thinks I&#146;m working on parts.I &#145;m working on concepts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I was talking about these concepts yesterday when

I said that a motorcycle can be divided according to its components and according to its

functions. When I said that suddenly I created a set of boxes with the following

arrangement:</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><img src="../images/zen1.png" /></p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And when I said the components may be subdivided

into a power assembly and a running assembly, suddenly appear some more little boxes:</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><img src="../images/zen2.png" /></p>





<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And you see that every time I made a further

division, up came more boxes based on these divisions until I had a huge pyramid of boxes.

Finally you see that while I was splitting the cycle up into finer and finer pieces, I was

also building a structure.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This structure of concepts is formally called a

hierarchy and since ancient times has been a basic structure for all Western knowledge.

Kingdoms, empires, churches, armies have all been structured into hierarchies. Modern

businesses are so structured. Tables of contents of reference material are so structured,

mechanical assemblies, computer software, all scientific and technical knowledge is so

structured...so much so that in some fields such as biology, the hierarchy of kingdom-</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">phylum-class-order-family-genus-species is almost

an icon.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The box &quot;motorcycle&quot; contains the boxes

&quot;components&quot; and &quot;functions.&quot; The box &quot;components&quot; contains

the boxes &quot;power assembly&quot; and &quot;running assembly,&quot; and so on. There

are many other kinds of structures produced by other operators such as &quot;causes&quot;

which produce long chain structures of the form, &quot;A causes B which causes C which

causes D,&quot; and so on. A functional description of the motorcycle uses this structure.

The operator&#146;s &quot;exists,&quot; &quot;equals,&quot; and &quot;implies&quot;

produce still other structures. These structures are normally interrelated in patterns and

paths so complex and so enormous no one person can understand more than a small part of

them in his lifetime. The overall name of these interrelated structures, the genus of

which the hierarchy of containment and structure of causation are just species, is system.

The motorcycle is a system. A real system.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To speak of certain government and establishment

institutions as &quot;the system&quot; is to speak correctly, since these organizations

are founded upon the same structural conceptual relationships as a motorcycle. They are

sustained by structural relationships even when they have lost all other meaning and

purpose. People arrive at a factory and perform a totally meaningless task from eight to

five without question because the structure demands that it be that way. There&#146;s no

villain, no &quot;mean guy&quot; who wants them to live meaningless lives, it&#146;s just

that the structure, the system demands it and no one is willing to take on the formidable

task of changing the structure just because it is meaningless.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a

government or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack effects

rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is possible.

The true system, the real system, is our present construction of systematic thought

itself, rationality itself, and if a factory is torn down but the rationality which

produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory.

If a revolution destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought

that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves

in the succeeding government. There&#146;s so much talk about the system. And so little

understanding.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">That&#146;s all the motorcycle is, a system of

concepts worked out in steel. There&#146;s no part in it, no shape in it, that is not out

of someone&#146;s mind&#151;number three tappet is right on too. One more to go. This had

better be it -- .I&#146;ve noticed that people who have never worked with steel have

trouble seeing this...that the motorcycle is primarily a mental phenomenon. They associate

metal with given shapes...pipes, rods, girders, tools, parts...all of them fixed and

inviolable, and think of it as primarily physical. But a person who does machining or

foundry work or forge work or welding sees &quot;steel&quot; as having no shape at all.

Steel can be any shape you want if you are skilled enough, and any shape but the one you

want if you are not. Shapes, like this tappet, are what you arrive at, what you give to

the steel. Steel has no more shape than this old pile of dirt on the engine here. These

shapes are all out of someone&#146;s mind. That&#146;s important to see. The steel? Hell,

even the steel is out of someone&#146;s mind. There&#146;s no steel in nature. Anyone from

the Bronze Age could have told you that. All nature has is a potential for steel.

There&#146;s nothing else there. But what&#146;s &quot;potential&quot;? That&#146;s also

in someone&#146;s mind! -- Ghosts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">That&#146;s really what Phaedrus was talking about

when he said it&#146;s all in the mind. It sounds insane when you just jump up and say it

without reference to anything specific like an engine. But when you tie it down to

something specific and concrete, the insane sound tends to disappear and you see he could

have been saying something of importance.</font></p>

<h2>Section 2</h2>

<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Stuckness. That&#146;s what I want to talk about

today.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Back on our trip out of Miles City you&#146;ll

remember I talked about how formal scientific method could be applied to the repair of a

motorcycle through the study of chains of cause and effect and the application of

experimental method to determine these chains. The purpose then was to show what was meant

by classic rationality.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now I want to show that that classic pattern of

rationality can be tremendously improved, expanded and made far more effective through the

formal recognition of Quality in its operation. Before doing this, however, I should go

over some of the negative aspects of traditional maintenance to show just where the

problems are.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The first is stuckness, a mental stuckness that

accompanies the physical stuckness of whatever it is you&#146;re working on. The same

thing Chris was suffering from. A screw sticks, for example, on a side cover assembly. You

check the manual to see if there might be any special cause for this screw to come off so

hard, but all it says is &quot;Remove side cover plate&quot; in that wonderful terse

technical style that never tells you what you want to know. There&#146;s no earlier

procedure left undone that might cause the cover screws to stick.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">If you&#146;re experienced you&#146;d probably

apply a penetrating liquid and an impact driver at this point. But suppose you&#146;re

inexperienced and you attach a self-locking plier wrench to the shank of your screwdriver

and really twist it hard, a procedure you&#146;ve had success with in the past, but which

this time succeeds only in tearing the slot of the screw.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Your mind was already thinking ahead to what you

would do when the cover plate was off, and so it takes a little time to realize that this

irritating minor annoyance of a torn screw slot isn&#146;t just irritating and minor.

You&#146;re stuck. Stopped. Terminated. It&#146;s absolutely stopped you from fixing the

motorcycle.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This isn&#146;t a rare scene in science or

technology. This is the commonest scene of all. Just plain stuck. In traditional

maintenance this is the worst of all moments, so bad that you have avoided even thinking

about it before you come to it.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The book&#146;s no good to you now. Neither is

scientific reason. You don&#146;t need any scientific experiments to find out what&#146;s

wrong. It&#146;s obvious what&#146;s wrong. What you need is an hypothesis for how

you&#146;re going to get that slotless screw out of there and scientific method

doesn&#146;t provide any of these hypotheses. It operates only after they&#146;re around.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This is the zero moment of consciousness. Stuck.

No answer. Honked. Kaput. It&#146;s a miserable experience emotionally. You&#146;re losing

time. You&#146;re incompetent. You don&#146;t know what you&#146;re doing. You should be

ashamed of yourself. You should take the machine to a real mechanic who knows how to

figure these things out.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It&#146;s normal at this point for the fear-anger

syndrome to take over and make you want to hammer on that side plate with a chisel, to

pound it off with a sledge if necessary. You think about it, and the more you think about

it the more you&#146;re inclined to take the whole machine to a high bridge and drop it

off. It&#146;s just outrageous that a tiny little slot of a screw can defeat you so

totally.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">What you&#146;re up against is the great unknown,

the void of all Western thought. You need some ideas, some hypotheses. Traditional

scientific method, unfortunately, has never quite gotten around to say exactly where to

pick up more of these hypotheses. Traditional scientific method has always been at the

very best, 20-20 hindsight. It&#146;s good for seeing where you&#146;ve been. It&#146;s

good for testing the truth of what you think you know, but it can&#146;t tell you where

you ought to go, unless where you ought to go is a continuation of where you were going in

the past. Creativity, originality, inventiveness, intuition,

imagination...&quot;unstuckness,&quot; in other words...are completely outside its domain.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">We continue down the canyon, past folds in the

steep slopes where wide streams enter. We notice the river grows rapidly now as streams

enlarge it. Turns in the road are less sharp here and straight stretches are longer. I

move into the highest gear.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Later the trees become scarce and spindly, with

large areas of grass and underbrush between them. It&#146;s too hot for the jacket and

sweater so I stop at a roadside pulloff to remove them.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Chris wants to go hiking up a trail and I let him,

finding a small shady spot to sit back and rest. Just quiet now, and meditative.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A display describes a fire burn that took place

here years ago. According to the information the forest is filling in again but it will be

years before it returns to its former condition.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Later the crunch of gravel tells me Chris is

coming back down the trail. He didn&#146;t go very far. When he arrives he says,

&quot;Let&#146;s go.&quot; We retie the pack, which has started to shift a little, and

then move out on the highway. The sweat from sitting there cools suddenly from the wind.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">We&#146;re still stuck on that screw and the only

way it&#146;s going to get unstuck is by abandoning further examination of the screw

according to traditional scientific method. That won&#146;t work. What we have to do is

examine traditional scientific method in the light of that stuck screw.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">We have been looking at that screw

&quot;objectively.&quot; According to the doctrine of &quot;objectivity,&quot; which is

integral with traditional scientific method, what we like or don&#146;t like about that

screw has nothing to do with our correct thinking. We should not evaluate what we see. We

should keep our mind a blank tablet which nature fills for us, and then reason

disinterestedly from the facts we observe.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But when we stop and think about it

disinterestedly, in terms of this stuck screw, we begin to see that this whole idea of

disinterested observation is silly. Where are those facts? What are we going to observe

disinterestedly? The torn slot? The immovable side cover plate? The color of the paint

job? The speedometer? The sissy bar? As Poincare would have said, there are an infinite

number of facts about the motorcycle, and the right ones don&#146;t just dance up and

introduce themselves. The right facts, the ones we really need, are not only passive, they

are damned elusive, and we&#146;re not going to just sit back and &quot;observe&quot;

them. We&#146;re going to have to be in there looking for them or we&#146;re going to be

here a long time. Forever. As Poincare pointed out, there must be a subliminal choice of

what facts we observe.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The difference between a good mechanic and a bad

one, like the difference between a good mathematician and a bad one, is precisely this

ability to select the good facts from the bad ones on the basis of quality. He has to

care! This is an ability about which formal traditional scientific method has nothing to

say. It&#146;s long past time to take a closer look at this qualitative preselection of

facts which has seemed so scrupulously ignored by those who make so much of these facts

after they are &quot;observed.&quot; I think that it will be found that a formal

acknowledgment of the role of Quality in the scientific process doesn&#146;t destroy the

empirical vision at all. It expands it, strengthens it and brings it far closer to actual

scientific practice.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I think the basic fault that underlies the problem

of stuckness is traditional rationality&#146;s insistence upon &quot;objectivity,&quot; a

doctrine that there is a divided reality of subject and object. For true science to take

place these must be rigidly separate from each other. &quot;You are the mechanic. There is

the motorcycle. You are forever apart from one another. You do this to it. You do that to

it. These will be the results.&quot;</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This eternally dualistic subject-object way of

approaching the motorcycle sounds right to us because we&#146;re used to it. But it&#146;s

not right. It&#146;s always been an artificial interpretation superimposed on reality.

It&#146;s never been reality itself. When this duality is completely accepted a certain

nondivided relationship between the mechanic and motorcycle, a craftsmanlike feeling for

the work, is destroyed. When traditional rationality divides the world into subjects and

objects it shuts out Quality, and when you&#146;re really stuck it&#146;s Quality, not any

subjects or objects, that tells you where you ought to go.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">By returning our attention to Quality it is hoped

that we can get technological work out of the noncaring subject-object dualism and back

into craftsmanlike self-involved reality again, which will reveal to us the facts we need

when we are stuck.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">In my mind now is an image of a huge, long

railroad train, one of those 120-boxcar jobs that cross the prairies all the time with

lumber and vegetables going east and with automobiles and other manufactured goods going

west. I want to call this railroad train &quot;knowledge&quot; and subdivide in into two

parts: Classic Knowledge and Romantic Knowledge.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">In terms of the analogy, Classic Knowledge, the

knowledge taught by the Church of Reason, is the engine and all the boxcars. All of them

and everything that&#146;s in them. If you subdivide the train into parts you will find no

Romantic Knowledge anywhere. And unless you&#146;re careful it&#146;s easy to make the

presumption that&#146;s all the train there is. This isn&#146;t because Romantic Knowledge

is nonexistent or even unimportant. It&#146;s just that so far the definition of the train

is static and purposeless. This was what I was trying to get at back in South Dakota when

I talked about two whole dimensions of existence. It&#146;s two whole ways of looking at

the train.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Romantic Quality, in terms of this analogy,

isn&#146;t any &quot;part&quot; of the train. It&#146;s the leading edge of the engine, a

two-dimensional surface of no real significance unless you understand that the train

isn&#146;t a static entity at all. A train really isn&#146;t a train if it can&#146;t go

anywhere. In the process of examining the train and subdividing it into parts we&#146;ve

inadvertently stopped it, so that it really isn&#146;t a train we are examining.

That&#146;s why we get stuck.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The real train of knowledge isn&#146;t a static

entity that can be stopped and subdivided. It&#146;s always going somewhere. On a track

called Quality. And that engine and all those 120 boxcars are never going anywhere except

where the track of Quality takes them; and romantic Quality, the leading edge of the

engine, takes them along that track.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Romantic reality is the cutting edge of

experience. It&#146;s the leading edge of the train of knowledge that keeps the whole

train on the track. Traditional knowledge is only the collective memory of where that

leading edge has been. At the leading edge there are no subjects, no objects, only the

track of Quality ahead, and if you have no formal way of evaluating, no way of

acknowledging this Quality, then the entire train has no way of knowing where to go. You

don&#146;t have pure reason...you have pure confusion. The leading edge is where

absolutely all the action is. The leading edge contains all the infinite possibilities of

the future. It contains all the history of the past. Where else could they be contained?</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The past cannot remember the past. The future

can&#146;t generate the future. The cutting edge of this instant right here and now is

always nothing less than the totality of everything there is.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Value, the leading edge of reality, is no longer

an irrelevant offshoot of structure. Value is the predecessor of structure. It&#146;s the

preintellectual awareness that gives rise to it. Our structured reality is preselected on

the basis of value, and really to understand structured reality requires an understanding

of the value source from which it&#146;s derived.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">One&#146;s rational understanding of a motorcycle

is therefore modified from minute to minute as one works on it and sees that a new and

different rational understanding has more Quality. One doesn&#146;t cling to old sticky

ideas because one has an immediate rational basis for rejecting them. Reality isn&#146;t

static anymore. It&#146;s not a set of ideas you have to either fight or resign yourself

to. It&#146;s made up, in part, of ideas that are expected to grow as you grow, and as we

all grow, century after century. With Quality as a central undefined term, reality is, in

its essential nature, not static but dynamic. And when you really understand dynamic

reality you never get stuck. It has forms but the forms are capable of change.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To put it in more concrete terms: If you want to

build a factory, or fix a motorcycle, or set a nation right without getting stuck, then

classical, structured, dualistic subject-object knowledge, although necessary, isn&#146;t

enough. You have to have some feeling for the quality of the work. You have to have a

sense of what&#146;s good. That is what carries you forward. This sense isn&#146;t just

something you&#146;re born with, although you are born with it. It&#146;s also something

you can develop. It&#146;s not just &quot;intuition,&quot; not just unexplainable

&quot;skill&quot; or &quot;talent.&quot; It&#146;s the direct result of contact with basic

reality, Quality, which dualistic reason has in the past tended to conceal.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It all sounds so far out and esoteric when

it&#146;s put like that it comes as a shock to discover that it is one of the most

homespun, down-to-earth views of reality you can have. Harry Truman, of all people, comes

to mind, when he said, concerning his administration&#146;s programs, &quot;We&#146;ll

just try them&#151;and if they don&#146;t work&#151;why then we&#146;ll just try something

else.&quot; That may not be an exact quote, but it&#146;s close.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The reality of the American government isn&#146;t

static, he said, it&#146;s dynamic. If we don&#146;t like it we&#146;ll get something

better. The American government isn&#146;t going to get stuck on any set of fancy

doctrinaire ideas.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The key word is &quot;better&quot;...Quality. Some

may argue that the underlying form of the American government is stuck, is incapable of

change in response to Quality, but that argument is not to the point. The point is that

the President and everyone else, from the wildest radical to the wildest reactionary,

agree that the government should change in response to Quality, even if it doesn&#146;t.

Phaedrus&#146; concept of changing Quality as reality, a reality so omnipotent that whole

governments must change to keep up with it, is something that in a wordless way we have

always unanimously believed in all along.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And what Harry Truman said, really, was nothing

different from the practical, pragmatic attitude of any laboratory scientist or any

engineer or any mechanic when he&#146;s not thinking &quot;objectively&quot; in the course

of his daily work.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I keep talking wild theory, but it keeps somehow

coming out stuff everybody knows, folklore. This Quality, this feeling for the work, is

something known in every shop.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now finally let&#146;s get back to that screw.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Let&#146;s consider a reevaluation of the

situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, the zero of consciousness,

isn&#146;t the worst of all possible situations, but the best possible situation you could

be in. After all, it&#146;s exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much

trouble to induce; through koans, deep breathing, sitting still and the like. Your mind is

empty, you have a &quot;hollow-flexible&quot; attitude of &quot;beginner&#146;s

mind.&quot; You&#146;re right at the front end of the train of knowledge, at the track of

reality itself. Consider, for a change, that this is a moment to be not feared but

cultivated. If your mind is truly, profoundly stuck, then you may be much better off than

when it was loaded with ideas.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The solution to the problem often at first seems

unimportant or undesirable, but the state of stuckness allows it, in time, to assume its

true importance. It seemed small because your previous rigid evaluation which led to the

stuckness made it small.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But now consider the fact that no matter how hard

you try to hang on to it, this stuckness is bound to disappear. Your mind will naturally

and freely move toward a solution. Unless you are a real master at staying stuck you

can&#146;t prevent this. The fear of stuckness is needless because the longer you stay

stuck the more you see the Quality...reality that gets you unstuck every time. What&#146;s

really been getting you stuck is the running from the stuckness through the cars of your

train of knowledge looking for a solution that is out in front of the train.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Stuckness shouldn&#146;t be avoided. It&#146;s the

psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key

to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It&#146;s

this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught

mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything

except a new situation.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Normally screws are so cheap and small and simple

you think of them as unimportant. But now, as your Quality awareness becomes stronger, you

realize that this one, individual, particular screw is neither cheap nor small nor

unimportant. Right now this screw is worth exactly the selling price of the whole

motorcycle, because the motorcycle is actually valueless until you get the screw out. With

this reevaluation of the screw comes a willingness to expand your knowledge of it.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">With the expansion of the knowledge, I would

guess, would come a reevaluation of what the screw really is. If you concentrate on it,

think about it, stay stuck on it for a long enough time, I would guess that in time you

will come to see that the screw is less and less an object typical of a class and more an

object unique in itself. Then with more concentration you will begin to see the screw as

not even an object at all but as a collection of functions. Your stuckness is gradually

eliminating patterns of traditional reason.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">In the past when you separated subject and object

from one another in a permanent way, your thinking about them got very rigid. You formed a

class called &quot;screw&quot; that seemed to be inviolable and more real than the reality

you are looking at. And you couldn&#146;t think of how to get unstuck because you

couldn&#146;t think of anything new, because you couldn&#146;t see anything new.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now, in getting that screw out, you aren&#146;t

interested in what it is. What it is has ceased to be a category of thought and is a

continuing direct experience. It&#146;s not in the boxcars anymore, it&#146;s out in front

and capable of change. You are interested in what it does and why it&#146;s doing it. You

will ask functional questions. Associated with your questions will be a subliminal Quality

discrimination identical to the Quality discrimination that led Poincare to the Fuchsian

equations.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">What your actual solution is is unimportant as

long as it has Quality. Thoughts about the screw as combined rigidness and adhesiveness

and about its special helical interlock might lead naturally to solutions of impaction and

use of solvents. That is one kind of Quality track. Another track may be to go to the

library and look through a catalog of mechanic&#146;s tools, in which you might come

across a screw extractor that would do the job. Or to call a friend who knows something

about mechanical work. Or just to drill the screw out, or just burn it out with a torch.

or you might just, as a result of your meditative attention to the screw, come up with

some new way of extracting it that has never been thought of before and that beats all the

rest and is patentable and makes you a millionaire five years from now. There&#146;s no

predicting what&#146;s on that Quality track. The solutions all are simple...after you

have arrived at them. But they&#146;re simple only when you know already what they are.</font></p>
