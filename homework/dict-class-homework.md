CSCI 150 HW: Dictionary and Class Homework
---------------------------------------

*Due: Wednesday, April 12*

**Grading Specifications**

You will earn a **Complete** provided that:
- all five problems are attempted,
- aFour of the five are completely correct; the fifth has a minor, non-obvious error not easily detectible through simple testing, and
- on all five, there is no confusion about print vs return values.

You will earn a **Partially Complete** provided that:
- at least four are attempted,
- at least two are completely correct,
- at least one class problem has a corerctly implemented `__init()__` method, and
- there is no confusion about print vs return values

Upload your code to the class Team page using the file name **HW9Lastname.py**. For each problem, in addition to the code itself, you should have one or more lines of comments which describe what happened, following the 3 steps below:

1\. **Design**: First, write a function or design a Python class as requested in the
  exercise.

2\. **Check**: Run the your code against the examples provided.  Does the actual
   output agree with the given correct output?

3\. **Evaluate**: If your answer in step 1 was different than the
   actual output, keep experimenting with it, consult an online
   reference, ask a friend or TA or professor, *etc.* until you can
   explain why the code works the way it does *and* what your
   misunderstanding(s) were in part 1.




1\. Write a function `vowel_count` which takes in a list of strings (all lower case) and returns a dictionary, keyed on the five vowels a, e, i, o, and u. The value for each should be the total number of entries in the list which contain at least a single copy of that vowel. For example,

- `vowel_count(['time', 'is', 'the', 'end'])` returns  `{'a': 0, 'e': 3, 'i': 2, 'o': 0, 'u': 0}`


- `vowel_count(['aardvark', 'facetious', 'too', 'to', 'two'])` returns `{'a': 2, 'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 4, 'u': 1}`

(note that we are not counting the total number of a's, or e's,
but how many individual entries in the list contain at least one a)

2\.  Write a function `char_remaining` which takes a string as input and returns a dictionary whose keys are the characters in the string and values are the number of characters in the string remaining after the *first* occurance of the keyed-character.  For example:

- `char_remaining('Hello')` returns `{'H': 4, 'e': 3, 'l': 2, 'o': 0}`
- `char_remaining('CSCI 150 class')` returns `{'C': 13, 'S': 12, 'I': 10, ' ': 9, '1': 8, '5': 7, '0': 6, 'c': 4, 'l': 3, 'a': 2, 's':1}`

3\.  Write a function `dict_count` which takes in two parameters: `d`, which is a dictionary keyed on strings with integer values, and `s` a single character string. The function should return an integer which is the sum of all values which correspond to keys which contain `s`.  For example:

- if `d = {'hi': 3, 'there': 2, 'bye': 6}` and `s = 'h'`, then `dict_count(d,s))` returns `5`
- if `d = {'hi': 3, 'there': 2, 'bye': 6}` and `s = 'a'`, then `dict_count(d,s))` returns `0`
- if `d = {'hi': 3, 'there': 2, 'bye': 6}` and `s = 'e'`, then `dict_count(d,s))` returns `8`

4\. Write a Python class `BouncyBall`, which represents a bouncy ball containing a certain amount of air.

- When a `BouncyBall` object is first created, it should have 10 units of air.
- There should be a method `bounce()` which normally prints the
    word `Bounce!` and decreases the amount of air in the ball by
    two units. However, if the amount of air is less than or equal to
    three, then `bounce()` does not decrease the amount of air
    and prints `Thupp.` instead of `Bounce!`
-  There should be a method `inflate()` which increases the
    amount of air by three units. If the amount of air ever becomes
    greater than 12, then the ball explodes by printing
    `BANG!!!`.
- You cannot bounce or inflate an exploded ball. After a ball explodes, calling `bounce()` or `inflate()` should
        just cause a message to be printed such as `Sorry, you cannot bounce this ball. It has exploded.`

To test your class, you can type in and run the following code:


    b = BouncyBall()
    for i in range(6):
      b.bounce()

    b.inflate()
    b.bounce()
    b.bounce()

    for i in range(5):
      b.inflate()

    b.bounce()


If you have done everything correctly, it should produce the following:

    Bounce!
    Bounce!
    Bounce!
    Bounce!
    Thupp.
    Thupp.
    Bounce!
    Thupp.
    BANG!!!
    Sorry, you cannot inflate this ball!  It has exploded.
    Sorry, you cannot bounce this ball!  It has exploded.


5\.

Write a Python class` Gradebook` which works as follows:
â€¢ When a new `Gradebook` object is first created, it should start out
with an empty list of grades, and zero points of extra credit.

- There should be a method `add_grade(g: int)` which adds the grade
`g` to the end of the list.
- There should be a `method add_ec(ec: int)` which adds `ec` points
of extra credit to the current amount of extra credit.
- There should be a method `average()` which computes and returns
the average of all the grades so far (the sum of all the grades, plus
the extra credit score, divided by the number of grades).


You can test your implementation of Gradebook by running the code below:

    def main():
      gb = Gradebook()
      gb.add_grade(90)
      gb.add_grade(83)
      gb.add_grade(97)
      gb.add_ec(10)

      print(gb.average())

    main()

If your definition of `Gradebook` is correct, this should print `93.33333333333333`
