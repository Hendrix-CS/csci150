CSCI 150 HW: CodingBat Conditional Practice and By-Hand Tracing
-----------------------------------------------

*Due: Wednesday, February 8*

This homework set has two components:
* CodingBat -- where you will write a bit of code (see below) and it will be automatically assessed
* By-hand tacing, which you will turn in an on-paper version in class

# CodingBat

You will want to make an account on CodingBat. Please use your Hendrix email as your account email.
Please also keep up with your own password -- there is no way for me to recover it for you!

 Be sure to share your progress with me, by going to "prefs" and entering
your instructor's email address (`seme@hendrix.edu` or `yorgey@hendrix.edu`) in the "Teacher Share" box.

You should complete at least 7 of the following:

# By-Hand Tracing

Turn in your by-hand tracing for each section of code shown below. You are *strongly* encouraged to check your answers
by typing the code into a Python interpreter (i.e. Kaggle). Your by-hand work should show the updating of values as necessary.

1.

    x = 7
    y = 2
    x = y - 3
    z = x + y ** 3


 2.

    a = 2
    b = a + 4
    a = a + 3

    if a == a + 3:
      c = 7
      a = 1
    else:
      c = a * b
      b = 10


## Specifications

- To be considered **complete** you must finish at least 7 of the CodingBat exercises and all values in your tracing must match the correct final values.
- To be considered **partial** you must finish at least 4 exercises, with an additional 3 attempted and at least one tracing problem has all correct final values.
