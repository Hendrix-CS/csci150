<h1>CSCI 150 HW<br>System Analysis</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

Together with your group, pick one of the following systems:

<ul>
  <li>A soccer game (or other sports event)</li>
  <li>A college class</li>
  <li>A hospital</li>
  <li>A zoo</li>
  <li>The US government</li>
  <li>The human body</li>
</ul>

Analyze the system by doing the following:
<ul>
  <li>Organize the components of the system in a "has-a"
  hierarchy.</li>
  <li>Organize some or all of the components in one or more "is-a"
    hierarchies.</li>
  <li>Pick some of the most important components and explain their
  functions&mdash;what do they do? (Do not say what
    their <i>purpose</i> is, only what they <i>do</i>.)</li>
  <li>How do the components interact?  What sort of information (data,
    money, people, hormones...) is exchanged between them?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your hierarchies can be presented either as a text outline with
indentation to indicate the different levels, or in graphical tree
form (for example, <a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a> is one
good option for making a tree diagram).

<p>
You should pick appropriate levels of detail&mdash;for example, your
hierarchies should have more than just one or two levels, but you do
not have to go crazy trying to add every possible detail (which would
of course amount to many, many books' worth!).

<h2>Presentation</h2>

You should be prepared to <b>present your analysis in class</b> on
Monday, taking a maximum of 8-10 minutes.  Plan to use appropriate
visual aids, such as the blackboard or slides.  (If you choose to use
the blackboard, you might want to plan ahead and have several members
of your group draw different things on the board simultaneously, to
save time.)

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>

You should turn in the following documents on Moodle:

<ul>
  <li>A document (in <tt>.pdf</tt>, <tt>.txt</tt>, or <tt>.doc</tt>
  format) with your answers to the above questions.</li>
  <li>If you made slides for your presentation, you should turn them
    in as well.</li>
</ul>
