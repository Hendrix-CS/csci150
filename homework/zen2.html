<h2>Section 2</h2>

<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Stuckness. That&#146;s what I want to talk about

today.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Back on our trip out of Miles City you&#146;ll

remember I talked about how formal scientific method could be applied to the repair of a

motorcycle through the study of chains of cause and effect and the application of

experimental method to determine these chains. The purpose then was to show what was meant

by classic rationality.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now I want to show that that classic pattern of

rationality can be tremendously improved, expanded and made far more effective through the

formal recognition of Quality in its operation. Before doing this, however, I should go

over some of the negative aspects of traditional maintenance to show just where the

problems are.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The first is stuckness, a mental stuckness that

accompanies the physical stuckness of whatever it is you&#146;re working on. The same

thing Chris was suffering from. A screw sticks, for example, on a side cover assembly. You

check the manual to see if there might be any special cause for this screw to come off so

hard, but all it says is &quot;Remove side cover plate&quot; in that wonderful terse

technical style that never tells you what you want to know. There&#146;s no earlier

procedure left undone that might cause the cover screws to stick.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">If you&#146;re experienced you&#146;d probably

apply a penetrating liquid and an impact driver at this point. But suppose you&#146;re

inexperienced and you attach a self-locking plier wrench to the shank of your screwdriver

and really twist it hard, a procedure you&#146;ve had success with in the past, but which

this time succeeds only in tearing the slot of the screw.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Your mind was already thinking ahead to what you

would do when the cover plate was off, and so it takes a little time to realize that this

irritating minor annoyance of a torn screw slot isn&#146;t just irritating and minor.

You&#146;re stuck. Stopped. Terminated. It&#146;s absolutely stopped you from fixing the

motorcycle.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This isn&#146;t a rare scene in science or

technology. This is the commonest scene of all. Just plain stuck. In traditional

maintenance this is the worst of all moments, so bad that you have avoided even thinking

about it before you come to it.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The book&#146;s no good to you now. Neither is

scientific reason. You don&#146;t need any scientific experiments to find out what&#146;s

wrong. It&#146;s obvious what&#146;s wrong. What you need is an hypothesis for how

you&#146;re going to get that slotless screw out of there and scientific method

doesn&#146;t provide any of these hypotheses. It operates only after they&#146;re around.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This is the zero moment of consciousness. Stuck.

No answer. Honked. Kaput. It&#146;s a miserable experience emotionally. You&#146;re losing

time. You&#146;re incompetent. You don&#146;t know what you&#146;re doing. You should be

ashamed of yourself. You should take the machine to a real mechanic who knows how to

figure these things out.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It&#146;s normal at this point for the fear-anger

syndrome to take over and make you want to hammer on that side plate with a chisel, to

pound it off with a sledge if necessary. You think about it, and the more you think about

it the more you&#146;re inclined to take the whole machine to a high bridge and drop it

off. It&#146;s just outrageous that a tiny little slot of a screw can defeat you so

totally.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">What you&#146;re up against is the great unknown,

the void of all Western thought. You need some ideas, some hypotheses. Traditional

scientific method, unfortunately, has never quite gotten around to say exactly where to

pick up more of these hypotheses. Traditional scientific method has always been at the

very best, 20-20 hindsight. It&#146;s good for seeing where you&#146;ve been. It&#146;s

good for testing the truth of what you think you know, but it can&#146;t tell you where

you ought to go, unless where you ought to go is a continuation of where you were going in

the past. Creativity, originality, inventiveness, intuition,

imagination...&quot;unstuckness,&quot; in other words...are completely outside its domain.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">We continue down the canyon, past folds in the

steep slopes where wide streams enter. We notice the river grows rapidly now as streams

enlarge it. Turns in the road are less sharp here and straight stretches are longer. I

move into the highest gear.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Later the trees become scarce and spindly, with

large areas of grass and underbrush between them. It&#146;s too hot for the jacket and

sweater so I stop at a roadside pulloff to remove them.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Chris wants to go hiking up a trail and I let him,

finding a small shady spot to sit back and rest. Just quiet now, and meditative.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">A display describes a fire burn that took place

here years ago. According to the information the forest is filling in again but it will be

years before it returns to its former condition.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Later the crunch of gravel tells me Chris is

coming back down the trail. He didn&#146;t go very far. When he arrives he says,

&quot;Let&#146;s go.&quot; We retie the pack, which has started to shift a little, and

then move out on the highway. The sweat from sitting there cools suddenly from the wind.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">We&#146;re still stuck on that screw and the only

way it&#146;s going to get unstuck is by abandoning further examination of the screw

according to traditional scientific method. That won&#146;t work. What we have to do is

examine traditional scientific method in the light of that stuck screw.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">We have been looking at that screw

&quot;objectively.&quot; According to the doctrine of &quot;objectivity,&quot; which is

integral with traditional scientific method, what we like or don&#146;t like about that

screw has nothing to do with our correct thinking. We should not evaluate what we see. We

should keep our mind a blank tablet which nature fills for us, and then reason

disinterestedly from the facts we observe.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But when we stop and think about it

disinterestedly, in terms of this stuck screw, we begin to see that this whole idea of

disinterested observation is silly. Where are those facts? What are we going to observe

disinterestedly? The torn slot? The immovable side cover plate? The color of the paint

job? The speedometer? The sissy bar? As Poincare would have said, there are an infinite

number of facts about the motorcycle, and the right ones don&#146;t just dance up and

introduce themselves. The right facts, the ones we really need, are not only passive, they

are damned elusive, and we&#146;re not going to just sit back and &quot;observe&quot;

them. We&#146;re going to have to be in there looking for them or we&#146;re going to be

here a long time. Forever. As Poincare pointed out, there must be a subliminal choice of

what facts we observe.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The difference between a good mechanic and a bad

one, like the difference between a good mathematician and a bad one, is precisely this

ability to select the good facts from the bad ones on the basis of quality. He has to

care! This is an ability about which formal traditional scientific method has nothing to

say. It&#146;s long past time to take a closer look at this qualitative preselection of

facts which has seemed so scrupulously ignored by those who make so much of these facts

after they are &quot;observed.&quot; I think that it will be found that a formal

acknowledgment of the role of Quality in the scientific process doesn&#146;t destroy the

empirical vision at all. It expands it, strengthens it and brings it far closer to actual

scientific practice.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I think the basic fault that underlies the problem

of stuckness is traditional rationality&#146;s insistence upon &quot;objectivity,&quot; a

doctrine that there is a divided reality of subject and object. For true science to take

place these must be rigidly separate from each other. &quot;You are the mechanic. There is

the motorcycle. You are forever apart from one another. You do this to it. You do that to

it. These will be the results.&quot;</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">This eternally dualistic subject-object way of

approaching the motorcycle sounds right to us because we&#146;re used to it. But it&#146;s

not right. It&#146;s always been an artificial interpretation superimposed on reality.

It&#146;s never been reality itself. When this duality is completely accepted a certain

nondivided relationship between the mechanic and motorcycle, a craftsmanlike feeling for

the work, is destroyed. When traditional rationality divides the world into subjects and

objects it shuts out Quality, and when you&#146;re really stuck it&#146;s Quality, not any

subjects or objects, that tells you where you ought to go.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">By returning our attention to Quality it is hoped

that we can get technological work out of the noncaring subject-object dualism and back

into craftsmanlike self-involved reality again, which will reveal to us the facts we need

when we are stuck.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">In my mind now is an image of a huge, long

railroad train, one of those 120-boxcar jobs that cross the prairies all the time with

lumber and vegetables going east and with automobiles and other manufactured goods going

west. I want to call this railroad train &quot;knowledge&quot; and subdivide in into two

parts: Classic Knowledge and Romantic Knowledge.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">In terms of the analogy, Classic Knowledge, the

knowledge taught by the Church of Reason, is the engine and all the boxcars. All of them

and everything that&#146;s in them. If you subdivide the train into parts you will find no

Romantic Knowledge anywhere. And unless you&#146;re careful it&#146;s easy to make the

presumption that&#146;s all the train there is. This isn&#146;t because Romantic Knowledge

is nonexistent or even unimportant. It&#146;s just that so far the definition of the train

is static and purposeless. This was what I was trying to get at back in South Dakota when

I talked about two whole dimensions of existence. It&#146;s two whole ways of looking at

the train.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Romantic Quality, in terms of this analogy,

isn&#146;t any &quot;part&quot; of the train. It&#146;s the leading edge of the engine, a

two-dimensional surface of no real significance unless you understand that the train

isn&#146;t a static entity at all. A train really isn&#146;t a train if it can&#146;t go

anywhere. In the process of examining the train and subdividing it into parts we&#146;ve

inadvertently stopped it, so that it really isn&#146;t a train we are examining.

That&#146;s why we get stuck.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The real train of knowledge isn&#146;t a static

entity that can be stopped and subdivided. It&#146;s always going somewhere. On a track

called Quality. And that engine and all those 120 boxcars are never going anywhere except

where the track of Quality takes them; and romantic Quality, the leading edge of the

engine, takes them along that track.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Romantic reality is the cutting edge of

experience. It&#146;s the leading edge of the train of knowledge that keeps the whole

train on the track. Traditional knowledge is only the collective memory of where that

leading edge has been. At the leading edge there are no subjects, no objects, only the

track of Quality ahead, and if you have no formal way of evaluating, no way of

acknowledging this Quality, then the entire train has no way of knowing where to go. You

don&#146;t have pure reason...you have pure confusion. The leading edge is where

absolutely all the action is. The leading edge contains all the infinite possibilities of

the future. It contains all the history of the past. Where else could they be contained?</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The past cannot remember the past. The future

can&#146;t generate the future. The cutting edge of this instant right here and now is

always nothing less than the totality of everything there is.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Value, the leading edge of reality, is no longer

an irrelevant offshoot of structure. Value is the predecessor of structure. It&#146;s the

preintellectual awareness that gives rise to it. Our structured reality is preselected on

the basis of value, and really to understand structured reality requires an understanding

of the value source from which it&#146;s derived.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">One&#146;s rational understanding of a motorcycle

is therefore modified from minute to minute as one works on it and sees that a new and

different rational understanding has more Quality. One doesn&#146;t cling to old sticky

ideas because one has an immediate rational basis for rejecting them. Reality isn&#146;t

static anymore. It&#146;s not a set of ideas you have to either fight or resign yourself

to. It&#146;s made up, in part, of ideas that are expected to grow as you grow, and as we

all grow, century after century. With Quality as a central undefined term, reality is, in

its essential nature, not static but dynamic. And when you really understand dynamic

reality you never get stuck. It has forms but the forms are capable of change.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">To put it in more concrete terms: If you want to

build a factory, or fix a motorcycle, or set a nation right without getting stuck, then

classical, structured, dualistic subject-object knowledge, although necessary, isn&#146;t

enough. You have to have some feeling for the quality of the work. You have to have a

sense of what&#146;s good. That is what carries you forward. This sense isn&#146;t just

something you&#146;re born with, although you are born with it. It&#146;s also something

you can develop. It&#146;s not just &quot;intuition,&quot; not just unexplainable

&quot;skill&quot; or &quot;talent.&quot; It&#146;s the direct result of contact with basic

reality, Quality, which dualistic reason has in the past tended to conceal.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">It all sounds so far out and esoteric when

it&#146;s put like that it comes as a shock to discover that it is one of the most

homespun, down-to-earth views of reality you can have. Harry Truman, of all people, comes

to mind, when he said, concerning his administration&#146;s programs, &quot;We&#146;ll

just try them&#151;and if they don&#146;t work&#151;why then we&#146;ll just try something

else.&quot; That may not be an exact quote, but it&#146;s close.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The reality of the American government isn&#146;t

static, he said, it&#146;s dynamic. If we don&#146;t like it we&#146;ll get something

better. The American government isn&#146;t going to get stuck on any set of fancy

doctrinaire ideas.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The key word is &quot;better&quot;...Quality. Some

may argue that the underlying form of the American government is stuck, is incapable of

change in response to Quality, but that argument is not to the point. The point is that

the President and everyone else, from the wildest radical to the wildest reactionary,

agree that the government should change in response to Quality, even if it doesn&#146;t.

Phaedrus&#146; concept of changing Quality as reality, a reality so omnipotent that whole

governments must change to keep up with it, is something that in a wordless way we have

always unanimously believed in all along.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">And what Harry Truman said, really, was nothing

different from the practical, pragmatic attitude of any laboratory scientist or any

engineer or any mechanic when he&#146;s not thinking &quot;objectively&quot; in the course

of his daily work.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">I keep talking wild theory, but it keeps somehow

coming out stuff everybody knows, folklore. This Quality, this feeling for the work, is

something known in every shop.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now finally let&#146;s get back to that screw.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Let&#146;s consider a reevaluation of the

situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, the zero of consciousness,

isn&#146;t the worst of all possible situations, but the best possible situation you could

be in. After all, it&#146;s exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much

trouble to induce; through koans, deep breathing, sitting still and the like. Your mind is

empty, you have a &quot;hollow-flexible&quot; attitude of &quot;beginner&#146;s

mind.&quot; You&#146;re right at the front end of the train of knowledge, at the track of

reality itself. Consider, for a change, that this is a moment to be not feared but

cultivated. If your mind is truly, profoundly stuck, then you may be much better off than

when it was loaded with ideas.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">The solution to the problem often at first seems

unimportant or undesirable, but the state of stuckness allows it, in time, to assume its

true importance. It seemed small because your previous rigid evaluation which led to the

stuckness made it small.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">But now consider the fact that no matter how hard

you try to hang on to it, this stuckness is bound to disappear. Your mind will naturally

and freely move toward a solution. Unless you are a real master at staying stuck you

can&#146;t prevent this. The fear of stuckness is needless because the longer you stay

stuck the more you see the Quality...reality that gets you unstuck every time. What&#146;s

really been getting you stuck is the running from the stuckness through the cars of your

train of knowledge looking for a solution that is out in front of the train.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Stuckness shouldn&#146;t be avoided. It&#146;s the

psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key

to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It&#146;s

this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught

mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything

except a new situation.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Normally screws are so cheap and small and simple

you think of them as unimportant. But now, as your Quality awareness becomes stronger, you

realize that this one, individual, particular screw is neither cheap nor small nor

unimportant. Right now this screw is worth exactly the selling price of the whole

motorcycle, because the motorcycle is actually valueless until you get the screw out. With

this reevaluation of the screw comes a willingness to expand your knowledge of it.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">With the expansion of the knowledge, I would

guess, would come a reevaluation of what the screw really is. If you concentrate on it,

think about it, stay stuck on it for a long enough time, I would guess that in time you

will come to see that the screw is less and less an object typical of a class and more an

object unique in itself. Then with more concentration you will begin to see the screw as

not even an object at all but as a collection of functions. Your stuckness is gradually

eliminating patterns of traditional reason.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">In the past when you separated subject and object

from one another in a permanent way, your thinking about them got very rigid. You formed a

class called &quot;screw&quot; that seemed to be inviolable and more real than the reality

you are looking at. And you couldn&#146;t think of how to get unstuck because you

couldn&#146;t think of anything new, because you couldn&#146;t see anything new.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">Now, in getting that screw out, you aren&#146;t

interested in what it is. What it is has ceased to be a category of thought and is a

continuing direct experience. It&#146;s not in the boxcars anymore, it&#146;s out in front

and capable of change. You are interested in what it does and why it&#146;s doing it. You

will ask functional questions. Associated with your questions will be a subliminal Quality

discrimination identical to the Quality discrimination that led Poincare to the Fuchsian

equations.</font></p>



<p><font face="Georgia,Arial,Helvetica">What your actual solution is is unimportant as

long as it has Quality. Thoughts about the screw as combined rigidness and adhesiveness

and about its special helical interlock might lead naturally to solutions of impaction and

use of solvents. That is one kind of Quality track. Another track may be to go to the

library and look through a catalog of mechanic&#146;s tools, in which you might come

across a screw extractor that would do the job. Or to call a friend who knows something

about mechanical work. Or just to drill the screw out, or just burn it out with a torch.

or you might just, as a result of your meditative attention to the screw, come up with

some new way of extracting it that has never been thought of before and that beats all the

rest and is patentable and makes you a millionaire five years from now. There&#146;s no

predicting what&#146;s on that Quality track. The solutions all are simple...after you

have arrived at them. But they&#146;re simple only when you know already what they are.</font></p>
