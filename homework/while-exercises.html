<h1>CSCI 150 HW - <br>While Exercises</h1>
<hr>


<h2>Description</h2>
Use the following exercises to gain more experience writing while loops for 
diverse programming situations. 1 and 2 were discussed in class. 2 HW points
will be awarded for working solutions on each additional exercise.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write a function that counts the number of digits that appear in a 
string received from the user.  For example, if the user inputs 
"12a3rt5", the function would return 4. 

<li>Write a function that requests a sequence of inputs from the user. 
The loop will end when the user types "ENTER". The first three 
letters of each input should be put together into a variable 
called "prefixes" which is returned at the end.

<li>Write a function that requests a sequence of inputs from the user. 
The loop will end when the user enters a non-integer. The sum 
of all the numbers should be returned at the end.

<li>Write a function like the previous one, except that it adds up the
odd numbers only.

<li>Write a function like #2, except that the sum of the lengths of the 
inputs is returned.

<li>Write a function that simulates a gambling game. The player starts 
with $100. Each time, the player is asked for a bet. The player
wins 30% of the time and loses 70% of the time. On a win, the player
wins double the bet. On a loss, the player loses the total bet. The loop 
ends when the player runs out of money, and returns how many
turns were played.

<li>Write a function that only ends when the user has typed in a valid 
floating point number (something that can be parsed by float()) and
returns it.
