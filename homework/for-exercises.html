<h1>CSCI 150 HW - <br>For Exercises</h1>
<hr>


<h2>Description</h2>
Use the following exercises to gain more experience writing while loops for 
diverse programming situations. 1 and 2 were discussed in class. 2 HW points
will be awarded for working solutions on each additional exercise.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
For each function below, use a "for" loop and the specified header.

<ol>
<li>Write a function count(s,c) to count the number of times a 
character is found in a string. 

<li>Write a function has_double(s) to determine if a word 
contains a double letter, returning True if two adjacent 
letters are identical, otherwise False.

<li>Write a function find(s, c) to find the first index of a 
character in a string. If the character is not found, return -1.

<li>Write a function find_all(s, c) to return a list of all the 
indices of a character in a string. If the character is not 
found, return the empty list.

<li>Write a function no_s(s) to return a string where all 
instances of the letter "s" have been removed.

<li>Write a function sum(t) to find the sum of the elements of a 
numeric list.

<li>Write a function mean(t) to find the mean of the elements of 
a numeric list.

<li>Write a function max(t) to find the maximum of the elements 
of a numeric list.

<li>Write a function classify(s) to classify a string of text. 
Return a string where all alphabetic characters have been 
replaced with "*".

<li>Write a function pow_2(n) to return a list of the powers of 
2 of length n.

<li>Write a function triangular(n) to return a list of the 
triangular numbers of length n. Triangular numbers are 
numbers that can be arranged to form a triangle. (1, 3, 6, 10, 
15, etc)
</ol>
