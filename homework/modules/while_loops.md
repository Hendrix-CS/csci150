*Due: Monday, September 29*

This is the first homework that uses CodingBat, an online place to practice writing code with immediate feedback. You will need to make a free account:
* Go to [codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com)
* Follow the instructions to make an account -- please use your Hendrix email as your account ID
* You can use any password you like
* Under the `prefs` tab (top right, next to your name), enter your professor's email in the Teacher Share Box (`seme@hendrix.edu` or `yorgey@hendrix.edu`)

Complete at least **five** of the following exercises in CodingBat.

- [Factorial](https://codingbat.com/prob/p267310)
- [Multiply_Odds](https://codingbat.com/prob/p252445)
- [triple_minus_one](https://codingbat.com/prob/p284602)
- [alternate_add](https://codingbat.com/prob/p278944)
- [find_square_root](https://codingbat.com/prob/p247057)
- [quadruple_minus_three](https://codingbat.com/prob/p257566)
- [compound_interest](https://codingbat.com/prob/p284403)
- [logarithm](https://codingbat.com/prob/p218022)


In addition, for the following two code snippets:

* **Predict**: First, complete the exercise *without* using the
   Python interpreter.

* **Check**: Run the code in a Kaggle notebook or PyCharm.  Does the actual
   output agree with what you wrote down in step 1?

* **Evaluate**: If your answer in step 1 was different than the
   actual output, keep experimenting with it, consult an online
   reference, ask a friend or TA or professor, *etc.* until you can
   explain why the code works the way it does *and* what your
   misunderstanding(s) were in part 1.



1. Write down everything that is printed:
```python
n = 5
i = 0
while i < n:
  print(i * n)
  i += 1

```

2. What is the value of `s` after the code is run?
```python
s = 5
i = 0
while i < 6:
  s += (i ** 2)
  i += 2
```
