*Due: Monday, February 2*

Remember that homework is not formally assessed. However, any problems turned in by the due date will be checked and feedback provided.

If you need to retake the associated module quiz, you *must* have the
homework completed and checked by your instructor before you retake the quiz.

For each exercise you should do the following:

1. **Predict**: First, complete the exercise *without* using the
   Python interpreter.

2. **Check**: Run the code in a Kaggle notebook.  Does the actual
   output agree with what you wrote down in step 1?

3. **Evaluate**: If your answer in step 1 was different than the
   actual output, keep experimenting with it, consult an online
   reference, ask a friend or TA or professor, *etc.* until you can
   explain why the code works the way it does *and* what your
   misunderstanding(s) were in part 1.

Some of the exercises use variables. Assume the variables have been initialized
as follows:
```
x = 7
y = 3
```

Exercises:
1. `4 * 3`
2. `7 / 2`
3. `0 / 7`
4. `7 / 0`
5. `10 - y * 2`
6. `4 + x + 18 / y`
7. `2 * (y + 4) + x`
8. `y**3 + x**2`

Your solution should be hand-written (or typed) and contain the following:

- For each line of code above, write down your *original* prediction.
- If your check (step 2) matched, put a check mark. Otherwise, put an X.
- If you wrote an X, then write a brief sentence explaining what you got wrong initially and why the code produces the answer it does.
