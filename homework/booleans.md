CSCI 150 HW: boolean practice
-----------------------------

*Due: Wednesday, February 3*

To receive full credit, for each exercise you should do the following:

1. **Predict**: First, complete the exercise *without* using the
   Python interpreter.

2. **Check**: Run the code in a Kaggle notebook.  Does the actual
   output agree with what you wrote down in step 1?

3. **Evaluate**: If your answer in step 1 was different than the
   actual output, keep experimenting with it, consult an online
   reference, ask a friend or TA or professor, *etc.* until you can
   explain why the code works the way it does *and* what your
   misunderstanding(s) were in part 1.

For each expression, decide whether it will evaluate to `True` or
`False`.

* `False and (True or False)`
* `(True and (not (False or False))) and (False or (True or False))`
* `3 ** 2 + 4 ** 2 == 5 ** 2`
* `50 < 99 / 3`
* `((1 < 2) and ("hi" > "there")) or (99 != 9)`
* `"egg" < "excellent"`
* `"arm" < "aardvark"`
* `False != (True != (False != (False != True)))`

As usual for this semester, you should submit your work as a PDF,
either by creating it on a computer in the first place or by scanning it.
