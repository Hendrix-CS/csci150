CSCI 150 HW: boolean practice
-----------------------------

*Due: Wednesday, September 6*

To receive full credit, for each exercise you should do the following:

1. **Predict**: First, complete the exercise *without* using the
   Python interpreter.

2. **Check**: Run the code in a Kaggle notebook.  Does the actual
   output agree with what you wrote down in step 1?

3. **Evaluate**: If your answer in step 1 was different than the
   actual output, keep experimenting with it, consult an online
   reference, ask a friend or TA or professor, *etc.* until you can
   explain why the code works the way it does *and* what your
   misunderstanding(s) were in part 1.

For each expression, decide whether it will evaluate to `True` or
`False`.

1. `False and (True or False)`
2. `(True and (not (False or False))) and (False or (True or False))`
3. `3 ** 2 + 4 ** 2 == 5 ** 2`
4. `50 < 99 / 3`
5. `((1 < 2) and ("hi" > "there")) or (99 != 9)`
6. `"egg" < "excellent"`
7. `"arm" < "aardvark"`
8. `False != (True != (False != (False != True)))`

Your solution should be hand-written (or typed) and contain the following:

- For each line of code above, write down your *original* prediction.
- If your check (step 2) matched, put a check mark. Otherwise, put an X.
- If you wrote an X, then write a brief sentence explaining what you got wrong initially and why the code produces the answer it does.

## Specifications

- To be considered **complete** you must work each given problem, and you must have the correct answer (after step 2 if needed), along with correct explanations where appropriate.
- An assignment will be considered **partial** if there are no more than 2 wrong answers (after step 2) and no more than two explanations that are given are incorrect.


<!---As usual for this semester, you should submit your work as a PDF,
either by creating it on a computer in the first place or by scanning it.-->
