<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Functional Practice</h1>
<h3>Assigned October 25th<br> 
Due Nov 1st 11:55 p.m.</h3> <hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This is repetitive practice writing functions for many different situations involving
strings, lists and boolean conditions.

<h2>Description</h2>
Success on large programming projects can depend on your ability to program small useful
functions.  For this practice, 
<ol>
<li>Write a function for each of the problems below.
<li>Make sure your function matches the outputs listed. 
</ol>

<h3>Sandwiches</h3>
A sandwich is two pieces of bread with something in between. Write a function
<code>getSandwich(s)</code> that will return the string that is between the first and 
last appearance of "bread" in the given string, or return the empty string "" if there
are not two pieces of bread.
<p>
<pre>
getSandwich("breadjambread") → "jam"
getSandwich("xxbreadjambreadyy") → "jam"
getSandwich("xxbreadyy") → "" 
</pre>

<h3>xyBalance</h3>
We'll say that a String is xy-balanced if for all the 'x' chars in the string, there is a 'y' 
char somewhere later in the string. So "xxy" is balanced, but "xyx" is not. 
Write a function <code>xyBalance(s)</code> that will return True if the given string is xy-balanced.
<p>
<pre>
xyBalance("aaxbby") → True
xyBalance("aaxbb") → False
xyBalance("yaaxbb") → False 
</pre>

<h3>TripleUp</h3>
Write a function <code>tripleUp(t)</code> that will return True if the list contains, 
somewhere, three increasing adjacent numbers like .... 4, 5, 6, ... or 23, 24, 25.
<p>
<pre>
tripleUp([1, 4, 5, 6, 2]) → True
tripleUp([1, 2, 3]) → True
tripleUp([1, 2, 4]) → False 
</pre>

<h3>evenOdd</h3>
Write a function <code>evenOdd(t)</code> that will return a list that contains the exact 
same numbers as the given list, but rearranged so that all the even numbers come before all
the odd numbers. Other than that, the numbers can be in any order. You may modify and return 
the given list, or make a new list.
<p>
<pre>
evenOdd([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]) → [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
evenOdd([3, 3, 2]) → [2, 3, 3]
evenOdd([2, 2, 2]) → [2, 2, 2] 
</pre>

<h3>canBalance</h3>
Given a non-empty list, write a function <code>canBalance(t)</code> that will return True if 
there is a place to split the list so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the 
sum of the numbers on the other side.
<p>
<pre>
canBalance([1, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → True
canBalance([2, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → False
canBalance([10, 10]) → True 
</pre>
