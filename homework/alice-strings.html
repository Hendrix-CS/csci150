<h1><a href="../index.html">CSC207</a> - Lab 8<br>Strings of Text</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab we examine some of the methods for manipulating strings of text.

<h2>Materials</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">String Methods</a> in Python
	<li><a href="../data/alice-chapter-one.txt">Alice in Wonderland</a>

</ul>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
Our first text for today comes from Lewis Carroll's poem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walrus_and_the_Carpenter">"The Walrus and the Carpenter."</a>
<p>
<pre>
s = """The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright--
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night."""
</pre>
<p>
As text is a major way of communicating with the user and storing information in a manner we can
easily understand, we will examine the built-in methods Python includes for manipulating these
strings.<p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
Now that you have some familiarity with string processing in Python, we will analyze a much
larger string from a file.
<p>
Download <a href="../data/alice-chapter-one.txt"><code>alice-chapter-one.txt</code></a> to your
working directory (the default where your files are saved).
<p>
Perform the following steps on the string, and record the results in a Google Doc for this lab:
<ol>
<li>Open this file through the interpreter and read in the data into a string.
<p>
This can be accomplished by typing 
<pre>
file = open("alice-chapter-one.txt", "r")
s = file.read()
</pre>
<p>
<li>Convert this string to uppercase and record
the last 10 characters.
<li>Remove all spaces and carriage returns from the string.
<li>Find and record the percent of remaining characters that are the letter E.
<li>Find and record the percent of remaining characters that are the letter T.
<li>How many sentences are there in this text?
<li>Where is the third mention of the word "SHE"?
<li>What is the ordinal value of the middle character of the text?
</ol>
<p>
<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Write up the answers to the above questions for Part 1 and Part 2 in a Google Doc, and share
this with me.
