CSCI 150 HW: Python tracing practice
------------------------------------

*Due: Monday, September 3*

To receive full credit, for each exercise you should do the following:

1. **Trace**: First, trace the execution of each Python program below,
   using the template shown in class.  That is, scratch work goes in
   the upper left; keep track of the types and values of any variables
   in the upper right; and show any output below.  You should complete
   the exercise *without* using the Python interpreter.  (You are
   welcome to refer to your notes or textbook, read Python
   documentation, look at examples from class, *etc.*; just don't
   actually run any code.)

2. **Check**: Run the code.  Does the actual output agree with what
   you wrote down in step 1?

3. **Evaluate**: If your answer to part 1 was different than the
   actual output, keep experimenting with it, consult the textbook or
   Python documentation, ask a friend or TA or professor, *etc.* until
   you can explain why the code works the way it does *and* what your
   misunderstanding(s) were in part 1.  (You do not need to do
   anything for step 3 if the output agrees exactly with what you
   wrote in step 1.)

You should consider the code in each exercise separately from the
other exercises.

1. Consider XXX

    ``` python
    ```

2. Consider XXX

    ``` python
    ```
