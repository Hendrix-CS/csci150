<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab we will be using for loops and functions to encrypt and decrypt secret messages
with a Caesar cipher.

<h2>Materials</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
The search for extraterrestrial intelligence has led us to explore physics, astrobiology, and
intelligence.  Our final topic to explore is our ability to understand any communications we 
eventually receive.  Since we do not currently have actual transmissions from alien intelligences,
we will instead look at the sciences of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decipherment">
Decipherment</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis">Cryptanalysis</a>.
<p>
Decipherment commonly looks to ancient texts and carvings as its source of intelligent but 
unintelligible communication.  These ancient languages such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs">
Egyptian Hieroglyphs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharoshthi">Kharoṣṭhī</a>
were forgotten and therefore unintelligible, until keys such as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_stone">Rosetta Stone</a> were found which had
the same information written in more than one text.
<p>Our task will be more challenging since
there will be no obvious key for the communication, yet a similar task to decipher the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome">human genome</a> has proven successful by
finding keys in chemistry and the physical properties of biology.  I hope that any
civilization attempting communication across space would provide similar clues by using 
universal properties from mathematics and physics.  This lab will explore the search for 
decipherment clues using a very simple encryption scheme.

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>
One of the first popular methods for encoding information is attributed to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>.  His
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a> was used to 
encrypt messages to his generals in the field.  While not a very secure method these days,
few people were literate and fewer would have known how to attempt any cryptanalysis
of his seemingly meaningless messages.
<p>
To perform encryption with a Caesar cipher, you first choose a number between 1 and 25, known as 
the <i>rotation</i>.  Then for each letter in your plain-text message, replace it with the character that is 
found by adding the rotation to the position of the character.  For instance, for a rotation of 4,
the letter F would be translated into J, since F is the 6th letter in the alphabet and J is the 10th.
If the position of the character plus the rotation is larger than 26 (the last letter Z), 
treat the alphabet as a loop and wrap 
around to the front.  Decryption is performed in a similar manner, but instead the rotation is 
subtracted from the character to return us to the original plain-text message. This  
encryption process is illustrated below (thanks to Wikipedia); decryption follows the 
arrows in reverse.
<p>

</div>
<p>
Open a new python program called <code>caesar.py</code>. In this file, you will 
first write two functions for encryption and decryption of strings.  
<p>
<code>encrypt(plain_text, rot)</code> will take a string and an integer rotation between 
0 and 25, (where 1 means A -> B, 2 means A -> C, etc) and return the rotated string.
<p>
<code>decrypt(cipher_text, rot)</code> will also take a string and an integer rotation
between 0 and 25 signifying the number of rotations backwards (where 1 means B -> A, 
2 mean C -> A, etc), and return the reverse-rotated string.
<p>
You can test your functions using string="GREEN" and rot=13; your answer should be "TERRA".  Also,
any string encrypted with rot should decrypt back with the same rot, such that
<p>
<pre>decrypt(encrypt("TESTING", i), i)
</pre>
<p>
should return "TESTING" for all feasible values of i.

<h3>Step 2</h3>
When faced with an encrypted text, we will not know what rotation was used for the encryption.
But since there are only 26 possible alignments (actually 25 since we know that our text is 
encrypted), we can iterate through them all in a reasonable amount of time.
<p>
Write a brute force function <code>brute_decrypt(string)</code> to print out all possible
Caesar rotations for a given string.  Use this function to decrypt the following lines 
of poetry (note: all four lines are encrypted with the same rotation).
<p>
<pre>
WZDV EULOOLJ DQG WKH VOLWKB WRYHV
GLG JBUH DQG JLPEOH LQ WKH ZDEH 
DOO PLPVB ZHUH WKH ERURJRYHV 
DQG WKH PRPH UDWKV RXWJUDEH
</pre>
<p>
Record the correct decryption and the rotation which was used in a Lab Evaluation.

<h3>Step 3</h3>
The above brute-force method requires there to be a human to examine each of the 
25 rotations and find the correct decryption.  If we wish to automatically decrypt
any Caesar-encrypted string, we must learn a bit about the distribution of characters
in the English language.
<p>
Our first tool for analysis will examine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis">
frequency</a> of each letter in a standard text.  While there are many different words and 
near infinite ways to combine them into sentences, there are regular patterns that we can observe
across all words. The figure below (from Wikipedia) shows the relative frequency of each character, derived
from counting the frequency of each character in a base text and then dividing by the total
number of characters.
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/English-slf.png">
</div>
<p>
This information has been used to simplify early Linotype machines, which ordered the 
characters to be typed by their frequency (leading to the sometimes cryptic inclusion of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETAOIN_SHRDLU">etaoin shrdlu</a> in newspaper articles).
<p>
Write a function in <code>caesar.py</code> called <code>frequency_count(s)</code>. 
This will return a list of relative frequencies for all letters A-Z found in the string.
Create a test string where you know the frequency of each character and make sure your
function returns the correct list of relative frequencies.

<h3>Step 4</h3>
As we are encoding and decrypting strings with a Caesar cipher, we can notice that the
relative frequency for an encrypted message will tend to follow (if the
string is long enough) the same pattern
as the above standard, but it will be rotated as well to match the rotation of the encryption.
<p>
With 25 possible rotations, we can now examine the relative frequency count from each one
and compare them to the base frequencies to find the best match.  For this, we need
one last tool, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_statistic">
Chi-square statistic</a>, shown below.
<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/6/5468d5913b7b4c1cb7eb6034f658bfed.png">
</div>
<p>
Given two frequency distributions (O for Observed, E for Expected), 
the Chi-square statistic will tell us how good of a fit 
there is between these two distributions.  Every observed frequency is compared to the expected
frequency and squared, then divided by the expected frequency.  These are summed
to return the Chi-square statistic.
<p>
For our purposes, we do not need to compare this
statistic to a table to see the probability of the match, we only need to find the rotation
that produces the minimum Chi-square statistic (note that a perfect match will result in 
a statistic of 0, and any differences will result in a positive increase).
<p>
Write a function <code>chi_square(observed_freq, expected_freq)</code> in your 
<code>caesar.py</code> to return the Chi-square statistic given the two frequency distributions.
This function should work as long as the two frequency distributions are the same length,
and also not be dependent on our specific use where the frequencies will be of length 26.
For example,
<p>
<pre>
chi_square([0.3, 0.1, 0.6], [0.1, 0.2, 0.7])
</pre>
<p>
should return 0.46428571428571419.

<h3>Step 5</h3>
Using your functions from the previous steps, write a new function
<code>auto_decrypt(s, base_text)</code> which takes an encrypted string and 
the file name of a base reference text.
Your function will calculate the character frequencies for the encrypted string
and the reference text, then iteratively calculate the Chi-square statistic for 
each possible reverse rotation.
Your function should print out the most likely rotation (minimum Chi-square statistic) 
and decrypted message 
along with the chi-squared statistic for that rotation.
<p>
Use <a href="../code/alice-chapter-one.txt">Chapter 1 of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland</a> as
the base text to decrypt the three messages below.
