<h2>Overview</h2>
  This lab will combine
  mathematics, instantiable classes, and bone-chilling terror. ;) Always
  a famous puzzle in the Artifical Intelligence circles, the WaterJug
  came to popular culture through the classic action
  movie <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Die+Hard%3A+With+a+Vengeance+(1995)">Die Hard III</A>.
  In Die Hard III, a mad bomber is chasing Bruce Willis
  and Samuel L. Jackson.  They must solve different puzzles or else
  things will explode and people will die.

  <H3>Example</H3>
  <p>
  The WaterJug puzzle can be explained as follows:<br />
  You have two
  jugs, A and B, and an infinite supply of water. There are three
  actions you can perform: (1) you can fill a jug to capacity, (2) you
  can completely empty a jug, and (3) you can pour from one jug to the
  other.  Pouring from one jug to the other stops when the first jug
  is empty or the second jug is full, whichever comes first. For
  example, if A has 5 gallons and B has 6 gallons and a capacity of 8,
  then pouring from A to B leaves B full and 3 gallons in A.
  <p>
  For this demonstration, we'll state that A has capacity 4 and
  B has capacity 3.  Our goal, which we must complete in less than one
  minute, is to somehow get exactly 2 gallons of water in jug A.  We need
  to find a set of operations, filling, emptying, and pouring, where
  we can reach this goal.  One possible solution is as follows:
  <p>
  FILL A<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  EMPTY B<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  FILL A<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  <p>
  We now have exactly 2 gallons of water jug in A.  (Try it!).  Phew,
  we're still alive!  Wouldn't it be nice to have a computer program
  to help us solve this?

  <h2>Step 1: The <code>WaterJug</code> class</h2>
  <p>
  Each <code>WaterJug</code> object will need to have two components
  that we can think of as the state of that <code>WaterJug</code>.
  <p>
  components:
  <UL>an integer for <code>capacity</code><br>
  an integer for <code>contents</code><br>
  </UL>
  <p>
  Also, a <code>WaterJug</code> needs some functionality to change the state of the internal components.
  In object-oriented programming, these are called methods.
  <p>
  methods:
  <UL><code>__init__( capacity, contents )</code> constructor method<br>
  <code>__repr__( )</code> to print off the components of the <code>WaterJug</code><br>
  <code>fill( )</code> to fill up the <code>WaterJug</code> completely<br>
  <code>empty( )</code> to completely empty the <code>WaterJug</code><br>
  <code>pour( other )</code> to pour as much of the contents of this <code>WaterJug</code> into the other as is allowed<br>
  </UL>

  <p> Implement this object in Python. Don't forget where to use
  the <code>self</code> keyword.  Be careful with your methods to make
  sure a malicious programmer (or buggy code) cannot violate the
  integrity of your class.  For example, it should never be possible
  to end up with a <code>WaterJug</code> with more <code>contents</code>
  than <code>capacity</code>.

  <p>
  Write a small <code>main</code> method to test that
  your <code>WaterJug</code> object works according to the description
  above.

  <h2>Step 2: The Puzzle</h2>

  Finally, implement a <code>main</code>
  function that allows the user to set up and then solve a WaterJugs
  puzzle.  Your function should:
  <UL>
  <li>Ask the user the capacity of the first <code>WaterJug</code>
  <li>Ask the user the capacity of the second <code>WaterJug</code>
  <li>Ask the user the goal quantity of water
  <li>Create the necessary empty <code>WaterJug</code> objects
  <li>While the goal has not been met:
  <ul>
  	 <li>Give the user a list of the options
  	 <li>Ask the user for their option selection
  	 <li>Perform the selected option
  </ul>
  <li>When the goal is met, print the solution path found by the user
  to reach the goal.
  </ul>

 <p>
 Of course, you should not just put everything in <code>main</code>,
 but you should break your code up into functions appropriately.  We
 have given you a <a href="../code/waterjug.py">starting file</a> with
 some useful functions you may use, so you don't have to reimplement
 them yourself.

<h2>Step 3: Generalizing</h2>

Generalize your program above so that it works with any number
of <code>WaterJugs</code> instead of just 2.  In particular, the
program should:
<ul>
  <li>Ask the user how many <code>WaterJug</code>s they want</li>
  <li>Prompt them for the capacity of each</li>
  <li>...and so on</li>
</ul>

 <p>
You never know when a Python class could save your life.  And
  remember, "Think fast, Look alive, Die hard."

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Turn in your code via Moodle. Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
You must hand in:
<ul>
  <li><code>waterjug.py</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To earn a D on this lab, complete Step 1.</li>
  <li>To earn a B on this lab, do all the above and complete Step 2.</li>
  <li>To earn an A on this lab, do all the above and complete Step 3.</li>
  <li>To earn a 100 on this lab, do all the above and write a
      paragraph explaining how you might write a Python program to
      automatically play the WaterJug game.</li>
</ul>
