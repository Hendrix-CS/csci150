<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 10<br>Die Hard III</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
  This lab will combine
  mathematics, instantiable classes, and bone-chilling terror. ;) Always
  a famous puzzle in the Artifical Intelligence circles, the 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVtQNK_ZUJg">WaterJug</a>
  came to popular culture through the classic action
  movie <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Die+Hard%3A+With+a+Vengeance+(1995)">Die Hard III</A>.
  In Die Hard III, a mad bomber is chasing Bruce Willis
  and Samuel L. Jackson.  They must solve different puzzles or else
  things will explode and people will die.

  <H3>Example</H3>
  <p>
  The WaterJug puzzle can be explained as follows:<br />
  You have two
  jugs, A and B, and an infinite supply of water. There are three
  actions you can perform: (1) you can fill a jug to capacity, (2) you
  can completely empty a jug, and (3) you can pour from one jug to the
  other.  Pouring from one jug to the other stops when the first jug
  is empty or the second jug is full, whichever comes first. For
  example, if A has 5 gallons and B has 6 gallons and a capacity of 8,
  then pouring from A to B leaves B full and 3 gallons in A.
  <p>
  For this demonstration, we'll state that A has capacity 4 and
  B has capacity 3.  Our goal, which we must complete in less than one
  minute, is to somehow get exactly 2 gallons of water in jug A.  We need
  to find a set of operations, filling, emptying, and pouring, where
  we can reach this goal.  One possible solution is as follows:
  <p>
  FILL A<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  EMPTY B<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  FILL A<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  <p>
  We now have exactly 2 gallons of water jug in A.  (Try it!).  Phew,
  we're still alive!  Wouldn't it be nice to have a computer program
  to help us solve this?

  <h2>Step 1: The <code>WaterJug</code> class</h2>
  <p>
  Each <code>WaterJug</code> object will need to have two components
  that we can think of as the state of that <code>WaterJug</code>.
  <p>
  components:
  <UL>an integer for <code>capacity</code><br>
  an integer for <code>contents</code><br>
  </UL>
  <p>
  Also, a <code>WaterJug</code> needs some functionality to change the state of the internal components.
  In object-oriented programming, these are called methods.
  <p>
  methods:
  <UL><code>__init__( capacity, contents )</code> constructor method<br>
  <code>__repr__( )</code> returns a string corresponding to code that recreates the <code>WaterJug</code> object<br>. It will contain values for
  all components of the object.<br>
  <code>fill( )</code> to fill up the <code>WaterJug</code> completely<br>
  <code>empty( )</code> to completely empty the <code>WaterJug</code><br>
  <code>pour( other )</code> to pour as much of the contents of this <code>WaterJug</code> into the other as is allowed<br>
  </UL>

  <p> Implement this object in Python. Don't forget where to use
  the <code>self</code> keyword.  Be careful with your methods to make
  sure a malicious programmer (or buggy code) cannot violate the
  integrity of your class.  For example, it should never be possible
  to end up with a <code>WaterJug</code> with more <code>contents</code>
  than <code>capacity</code>.

  <p> Your code should go in a file named <code>waterjug.py</code>.
  At the end of that file, place the following lines of code:
<pre>
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()
</pre>

  <p> Above that, write a function named <code>test()</code> that tests 
  your class and ensures that it works.  Make sure your test code uses all 
  of the methods of the class.  It should employ <code>if</code>
  statements to check whether each test passes. If a test fails,
  it should print an appropriate message. If all tests pass, it should
  print a success message.

  <p> The <tt>__repr__</tt> method needs to return a string that, if 
  typed into the Python shell, would reconstruct the original object.
  The <tt>str</tt> function calls <tt>__repr__</tt> for its argument
  in order to create its string representation. The <tt>eval</tt> 
  function calls the Python interpreter to execute its string argument.
  The following function will test whether <tt>__repr__</tt> works for
  any class:

<p>
<pre>
def test_repr(obj):
    return str(obj) == str(eval(str(obj)))
</pre>
</p>

  <h2>Step 2: The Puzzle</h2>

  In a new file, <tt>step2.py</tt>, write a program
  that allows the user to set up and then solve a 
  <tt>WaterJugs</tt> puzzle.  To use the <tt>WaterJug</tt> class, 
  you will need the following line at the top of your file:

<p>
<pre>
from waterjug import WaterJug
</pre>
</p>

  <p>
  Your program should:
  <UL>
  <li>Ask the user the capacity of the first <code>WaterJug</code>
  <li>Ask the user the capacity of the second <code>WaterJug</code>
  <li>Ask the user the goal quantity of water
  <li>Create the necessary empty <code>WaterJug</code> objects
  <li>While the goal has not been met:
  <ul>
  	 <li>Give the user a list of the options
  	 <li>Ask the user for their option selection
  	 <li>Perform the selected option
  </ul>
  <li>When the goal is met, print the solution path found by the user
  to reach the goal. You will need to maintain this solution path 
  using a list or a string.
  </ul>

 <p>
 <strong>It is not necessary to validate user input.</strong> For this
 assignment, you may assume that all user input is valid.
 Also, you should not just put everything in <code>main</code>,
 but you should break your code up into functions appropriately.  

<h2>Step 3: Generalizing</h2>

In a new file, <tt>step3.py</tt>, generalize your program from Step 2 so
that it works with any number
of <code>WaterJugs</code> instead of just 2.  In particular, the
program should:
<ul>
  <li>Ask the user how many <code>WaterJug</code>s they want</li>
  <li>Prompt them for the capacity of each</li>
  <li>...and so on</li>
</ul>

 <p>
You never know when a Python class could save your life.  And
  remember, "Think fast, Look alive, Die hard."

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Turn in your code via Moodle. Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
You must hand in:
<ul>
  <li><code>waterjug.py</code></li>
  <li><code>step2.py</code></li>
  <li><code>step3.py</code></li>
  <li> Optional Lab Evalution Document (see Grading)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To earn a D on this lab, complete Step 1.</li>
  <li>To earn a B on this lab, do all the above and complete Step 2.</li>
  <li>To earn an A on this lab, do all the above and complete Step 3.</li>
  <li>To earn a 100 on this lab, do all the above and write a
      paragraph explaining how you might write a Python program to
      automatically play the WaterJug game.</li>
</ul>
