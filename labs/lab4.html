<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 4<br>This Day in History</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Many systems have been devised over the years for keeping time.  In this lab, you will
explore some of the oddities present in our current calendar system by using a formula 
to calculate the day of the week for any given day between 1700 and 2299.
<p>
In particular, this lab will review the following concepts we have discussed in class:
<ul>
	<li>Input / Output
	<li>Math module
	<li>Conditionals
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
Over the centuries, our calendar has been realigned many times to coincide with growth in
our astronomical knowledge. Incorporating elements of both the solar and lunar cycle, the
current international standard calendar is the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian Calendar</a>, first
adopted in 1582. There are 
seven days a week due to religious influence, 12 months to a year in honor of
the lunar cycle, and 365 days a year in relation to the earth's orbital period
around the sun, with enough
leap days included to properly align the system with the true 
orbital period of approximately 365.242190419 days.  
While better than the Egyptian and Roman calendars in use at the time of adoption, it is still
an approximation with room for improvement, from the more-precise 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendar">Iranian Calendar</a> to
a standardized and perpetual 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Calendar">World Calendar</a>. 
<p>
One of the more interesting quirks of the Gregorian Calendar is that
each year can start on a different day of the week, since 365 is not
a multiple of 7. But there is a simple algorithm (based on the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Algorithm">Doomsday Rule</a>) that 
you can memorize to find the day of the 
week for any date in this century.
<ol>
	<li>Find the last 2 digits of the year. Divide this by four (using integer division) 
	and sum these two together to get <code>y</code>.
   	<li>Get the corresponding offset (shown below) for the month for <code>m</code>.
   	<li>Take the day to get <code>d</code>
   	<li>Add <code>y</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>d</code> together to find <code>dow</code>.
	<!--<li>Add the year offset (also shown below) to <code>dow</code>.
	<li>If the year is a leap year and the month is January or February, subtract 1 from 
	<code>dow</code>. -->
   	<li><code>dow</code> mod 7 corresponds to the day of the week. (0 = Sunday, 
   	1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.)
</ol>

<div align="center">
<b>Table for Month Offset</b>
<p>
<table border=1><tr>
<th>Jan</th><th>Feb</th><th>Mar</th><th>Apr</th><th>May</th><th>Jun</th>
<th>Jul</th><th>Aug</th><th>Sep</th><th>Oct</th><th>Nov</th><th>Dec</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>6</th><th>2</th><th>2</th><th>5</th><th>0</th><th>3</th>
<th>5</th><th>1</th><th>4</th><th>6</th><th>2</th><th>4</th></tr>
</table>
<p>
</div>

For example, if you wish to know the day of the week for September 15th, 2017, these
are the steps you would take:
<ol>
	<li>17 (last 2 digits of year) + 4 (last two digits, divided by 4) = 21
	<li>4 (month offset for September)
	<li>15 (day of month)
	<li>21 + 4 + 15 = 40
	<li>40 % 7 = 5 for Thursday
</ol>

For this lab, you will write a Python program called <code>dow.py</code>. We will
incrementally improve this program, both in accuracy and in style.

<h2>Step 1 - Initial Program</h2>
Our first version of this program will first tell the user about the program, and then take as input from the user 
the date they wish to use for finding the day of the week.  This input must be in the
form of three questions to the user, first the year, then the month
(as a number),
then the day.  For example, you would type in 2017, then 9, then 15 for
September 15th, 2017.
<p>
With correct input, your program will then parse this input into the year, month and day,
follow the above algorithm to compute the day of the week, and output this to the user
as a number. So for the above entry, your program will output 4.

Test your code on the following dates to ensure you are getting the right answers.  
<p>
<ul>
	<li>A total solar eclipse occurred over the continental United States on 
	Monday, August 21, 2017.
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar">The 
	Mesoamerican Long Count calendar</a> used by the Mayans began a new cycle on
	Friday, December 21, 2012.  Some people thought this would be the end of the world.
</ul>

<h2>Step 2 - Other Centuries</h2>

With a small change, our formula can be extended to work between 
Jan 1st, 1700 and Dec 31st, 2299. To do this, we need an additional offset table for the year.
<p>
<div align="center">
<b>Table for Year Offset</b>
<p>
<table border=1><tr>
<th>1700 - 1799</th><th>1800 - 1899</th><th>1900 - 1999</th><th>2000 - 2099</th><th>2100 - 2199</th><th>2200 - 2299</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>5</th><th>3</th><th>1</th><th>0</th><th>-2</th><th>-4</th></tr>
</table>
<p>
</div>
<p>
Our algorithm is now augmented with an additional step, highlighted below. Change your code
to work for any date in the above range.
<ol>
	<li>Find the last 2 digits of the year. Divide this by four (using integer division) 
	and sum these two together to get <code>y</code>.
   	<li>Get the corresponding offset (shown above) for the month for <code>m</code>.
   	<li>Take the day to get <code>d</code>
   	<li>Add <code>y</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>d</code> together to find <code>dow</code>.
	<li><b>Add the year offset (shown below) to <code>dow</code>.</b>
   	<li><code>dow</code> mod 7 corresponds to the day of the week. (0 = Sunday, 
   	1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.)
</ol>


Test your code on the following dates to ensure you are getting the right answers.  
<p>
<ul>
    <li>George Washington died on Saturday, December 14, 1799.
    <li>Ada Lovelace was born on Sunday, December 10, 1815.
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message">The Arecibo message</a>
	was beamed into space on Saturday, 16 November 1974.
    <li>Venus will eclipse Jupiter on Tuesday, September 14, 2123.
    <li>The <i>Enterprise</i> begins its five-year mission on Monday, January 2, 2265.
</ul>

<h2>Step 3 - Leap Years</h2>
Our formula has a subtle problem. If the year in question is a leap year, there is an extra
day on February 29th! This can be accommodated by adding one more step to our algorithm, 
again highlighted below.
<ol>
	<li>Find the last 2 digits of the year. Divide this by four (using integer division) 
	and sum these two together to get <code>y</code>.
   	<li>Get the corresponding offset (shown above) for the month for <code>m</code>.
   	<li>Take the day to get <code>d</code>
   	<li>Add <code>y</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>d</code> together to find <code>dow</code>.
	<li>Add the year offset (also shown above) to <code>dow</code>.
	<li><b>If the year is a leap year and the month is January or February, subtract 1 from 
	<code>dow</code>.</b>
   	<li><code>dow</code> mod 7 corresponds to the day of the week. (0 = Sunday, 
   	1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.)
</ol>
Leap year calculations usually are necessary for every fourth year, but not always.
Under the Gregorian Calendar, a year is a leap year (such that February has 29 days) if it is a 
multiple of four, except when it is also a multiple of 100 but not 400. So, 1900 and
2100 are not leap years, but 2000 is a leap year.

Test your code on the following dates to ensure you are getting the right answers.  
<p>
<ul>
   <li>Napoleon Bonaparte was elected First Consul of France on Friday, February 7, 1800.
   <li>Vienna debut of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._5_(Beethoven)">Piano Concerto No. 5</a> was performed by his student <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Czerny">Carl Czerny</a> on Wednesday, Feburary 12, 1812.
   <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini">Puccini</a>'s opera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosca">Tosca</a> premiered in Rome Italy on Sunday, January 14, 1900.
   <li>Groundhog Day, Sunday, February 2, 1992.
   <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagish_Lake_(meteorite)">Tagish Lake Meteorite</a> lands on Tuesday, January 18, 2000.
</ul>

<h2>Step 4 - Formatting</h2>

<h2>Coding</h2>
Our code is calculating the correct day of the week, but is not very useful to people.
Change your code to produce output
in the following format <b>exactly</b> (using September 15th, 2017 as an example):
<p>
<code>In the Gregorian Calendar, September 15th, 2017 falls on a Friday.</code>
<p>
For dates, use st, nd, rd and th suffixes appropriately. (If English is
not your first language, feel free to ask your instructor for help
understanding the rules for these suffixes. English is very strange!).
<p>
<b>Be sure to use <i>exactly</i> the right input and output formats as
  described above!</b>  You are free to be creative in the text you
  display when prompting the user, and in any other text your program
  displays before the final day of the week output, but part of your
  grade will be based on your adherence to the input and output format
  requirements.  For example, a program receiving full credit might
have output like the following:

<pre>
Welcome to the Day of the Week Finder!
Please enter the year: <span>2017</span>
Please enter the month, as a number between 1-12: <span>9</span>
Please enter the day of the month: <span>15</span>
In the Gregorian Calendar, September 15th, 2017 falls on a Thursday.
</pre>

<h2>Step 5 - Testing</h2>
Test your code on all the above dates to ensure you are getting the right answers.  
Also test your birthday, and find three other dates than 
these for your own testing, one of which is in January or February of a leap year.
