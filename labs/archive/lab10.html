<ul>
<li>Lab Partner

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab, we will be learning to use and reason about components in hierarchies, 
through programming mobile phone apps. We will use 
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a>, an easy-to-program
system that returns us once again to block programming similar to Scratch and ModKit.

<h2>Step 1: Setup</h2>
To use App Inventor, you will need two pieces: an Android mobile phone, and a Google account. 
If you or your partner do not have an Android mobile phone, we will have some available
for use during this lab.
<p>
You will need to connect your phone to WiFi, and
have the MIT AI2 Companion App installed on your phone. 
<p>
Follow the 
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup.html">Setup Instructions</a>
on the App Inventor website, choosing Option 1.

<h2>Step 2: Hello Purr</h2>
Each app we make will involve two main parts, using the
<a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor Editor</a>. 
<p>
First, 
we will be adding components and setting up the layout
for the visual interface in the <b>Designer</b> window. In every project, you will first
find this Designer window with four main parts. On the left is the <b>Palette</b>,
which lists off all the possible components you could add to your apps. The 
<b>Viewer</b> displays the GUI and visual structure of your app. Next is the 
<b>Components</b> hierarchy, showing the has-a structure of your app.
Finally, the <b>Properties</b> will show the individual attribues of each component
and allows you to edit them. The general structure of making the design is to
drag components from the Palette onto the Viewer, then select them in the Components
hierarchy and edit their attributes.
<p>
Second, we can then 
add the functionality for these components through writing code
in the Blocks window. There are many built-in blocks available in 
every app, and the components we specifically dragged out of the palette will
also have blocks that show up in the <b>Blocks</b> window on the left. To
add functionality to your programs, drag out the
blocks you need into the <b>Viewer</b> window and assemble them into
your program.
<p>
Your first app to make is called
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/hellopurr.html">HelloPurr</a>,
in which you will create a button with an image of a cat, and then tap the
button to make it meow.
<p>
<h3>Explore</h3>
Add another image button to your app and a new associated sound, so the user can
either tap on the cat or your new image.

<h2>Step 3: Three Basic Tutorials</h2>
You now have learned the basics of making an app. Expand your skills and 
knowledge of the possible components in App Inventor by working through
the three beginner tutorial apps:
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/beginner-videos.html">TalkToMe, BallBounce, DigitalDoodle</a>
<p>
<h3>Explore</h3>
Each of the above tutorials includes extensions at the end of the PDF. Implement
one of these extensions for each of these tutorials.

<h2>Step 4: Mole Mash</h2>
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/molemash.html">Mole Mash</a> is a
more complicated app using the Canvas and Sprites to create a simulation of
the carnival game Whack-A-Mole.
<p>
<h3>Explore</h3>
Complete the two extensions at the end of the tutorial, where you vary the 
speed of the Mole depending on the user's score, and then record both hits and misses
of the user.

<h2>Step 5: More Tutorials</h2>
<a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html">More Tutorials</a>
are available on the App Inventor website. Choose one of them and implement 
it.

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>

Demonstrate your working apps for each step to your lab instructor for credit.
