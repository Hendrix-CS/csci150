</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
We have created graphics and patterns using the turtle module in Python. This lab 
explores a complete graphical animation framework called Processing, using the Python
module.
<p>
For today's lab, download the latest version of Processing (3.0.1) for your operating
system. Once downloaded and opened, you will find in the upper-left corner of the 
screen a box that says "Java". Select this box, and choose "Add Mode". Select 
"Python Mode for Processing 3" and then click "Install" in the lower-right 
portion of the Mode window. You are now ready to work through the lab.

<h2>Step 1 - Faces</h2>
When we draw on the screen, we first need to be familiar with the
coordinate system. We denote the width as x and the height as y.
Most computer graphics modules, Processing included,
specify that the x, y origin (0,0) is located in the upper-left corner of the screen.
<p>
There are three common things to draw in Processing, an ellipse, a rectangle, and a line.
Write the following lines of code in Processing and press the Play button.
<p>
<pre>
ellipse(10, 10, 20, 20)
rect(10, 10, 20, 20)
line(10, 10, 20, 20)
</pre>
<p>
You should see an image like this:
<p>
<img width="150" src="../images/processing1.png">
<p>
An ellipse takes four arguments, the first two being the x, y center of the ellipse,
followed by the width, then the height. A rect also takes four arguments, the
first two being the upper-left coordinate of the rectangle, again followed
by width and height. A line takes four arguments, the first two being
the starting x, y coordinate, and the last two being the ending x, y coordinate.
<p>
Also, notice that the first thing to be drawn is covered by the images
that follow. This indicates that the way that images are drawn, 
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order">Z-order</a>, is based on time.
<p>

<h3>Task</h3>
Use ellipse, rect, and line to draw a face on the screen. At a minimum, the face should
have eyes, ears, a mouth and a nose. You can find more shapes on the 
<a href="http://py.processing.org/reference/">Python Reference for Processing</a> page.

<h2>Step 2 - Colors</h2>
Three different portions of our drawing can be altered to include colors. Recall
the hexadecimal representation of colors discussed earlier in class, where the
computer understands a color to be composed of three components, Red, Green, and Blue.
Each of the three functions below take a hex string as an argument denoting the color.
<p>
The background function will paint the whole screen the given color. The fill 
function changes the color to be painted within the ellipse or rect images. The
stroke function changes the color to be painted as the border for all three
images above.
<p>
<pre>
background("#FFFFFF")
fill("#00FFFF")
stroke("#FF0000")
</pre>
<p>
There is only one pen being used for Processing, so if we want to change colors
of the things we draw, we need to call <code>fill</code> or <code>stroke</code>
in between each of our drawing calls.
<p>
It will be convenient to have some of our basic colors defined in a dictionary.
<pre>
COLORS = {"black":"#000000", "white":"#FFFFFF",
          "red":"#FF0000", "green":"#00FF00",
          "blue":"#0000FF", "yellow":"#FFFF00",
          "orange":"#FFA500", "purple":"#9B30FF"}
</pre>

<h3>Task</h3>
Use the above shapes and color functions, along with any others you might 
find useful on the
<a href="http://py.processing.org/reference/">Python Processing Reference</a>
page, to enhance your earlier image of a face.

<h2>Step 3 - Functions</h2>
As our program is about to get more complicated, it is a good idea to start using
functions. There are two important functions that come with Processing by default.
<h3>Setup</h3>
The setup function is the first thing called by your program. In this function, you
should first set up the screen size.
<p>
The default screen size is 100 x 100. This can be changed by adding the following
function call at the beginning of your code, for example, to make a screen
with a width of 640 pixels and height of 480 pixels:
<pre>
def setup():
	size(640, 480)
</pre>

<h3>Draw</h3>
The draw function is called by Processing for every frame of the animation.
Put your earlier face code in this draw function, and press play. For example:
<p>
<pre>
def draw():
	background(COLORS["black"])
	fill(COLORS["red"])
	stroke(COLORS["green"])
	ellipse(50, 50, 100, 100)
	fill(COLORS["yellow"])
	ellipse(25, 25, 35, 35)
	ellipse(75, 25, 35, 35)
	stroke(COLORS["orange"])
	line(30, 80, 70, 80)
</pre>
<p>
It should look
exactly the same as it did above, but now we will have the ability to change the face
for each frame.

<h2>Step 4 - Faces in Space</h2>
All of our images so far have been static. To add animations, we need to start
remembering the state of our images and creating methods for how it will change.
The natural way to do this is to create new object, and in particular, we will
be representing Faces floating in space.
<p>
We will represent a Face with a class in Python. The face will need to remember
the x,y coordinates for the center of the face. We will also remember the base color
use for the case, in the example above, this was red. Notice how the draw function
abstracts away the initial face to be centered around any x,y coordinates. This will 
let us move the face around the screen.
<p>
<pre>
class Face:
	def __init__(self, x, y, color):
		self.x = x
		self.y = y
		self.color = color
		
	def draw(self):
		fill(self.color)
		stroke(COLORS["green"])
		ellipse(self.x, self.y, 100, 100)
		fill(COLORS["yellow"])
		ellipse(self.x - 25, self.y - 25, 35, 35)
		ellipse(self.x + 25, self.y - 25, 35, 35)
		stroke(COLORS["orange"])
		line(self.x - 20, self.y + 30, self.y + 20, self.y + 30)
</pre>
<p>
We will collect our Face instances in a list called faces, declared outside of any
of the above functions.
<p>
<pre>
faces = []
</pre>
<p>
And change our setup and draw functions to initialize the face and draw it, respectively.
<p>
<pre>
def setup():
    size(640, 480)
    faces.append(Face(50, 50, COLORS["red"]))
    
def draw():
    background("#000000")
    for f in faces:
        f.draw()
</pre>
<p>
Try moving your face around the screen, and changing its color, 
by altering the arguments you use to 
create the Face in the setup function.

<h3>Task</h3>
Change the setup function to add multiple faces at random locations and
with random colors around the screen. Make sure your locations are chosen so that
the face is always completely visible on the screen.

<h3>Task</h3>
Add a size component to your Face, so the setup method can also initialize the
size. Change your draw method of Face to account for this new size component, and
test it out by drawing random smaller and larger faces.

<h2>Step 5 - Movement</h2>
With the faces being drawn by an object, we can now make these objects move. Add
new components to your Face, called velx and vely, to capture the velocity of the
Face. For now, initialize them to 1, so they will be moving at a speed
of 1 pixel per update, as shown here:
<p>
<pre>
		self.velx = 1.0
		self.vely = 1.0
</pre>
<p>
Next, add a new method to your Face called update. When called, this function will change
the values of self.x and self.y by the velocity, and thus simulate movement.
<p>
<pre>
	def update(self):
		self.x += self.velx
		self.y += self.vely
</pre>
<p>
Finally, inside the main draw function, add a call to the update method of each face 
before the individual draw method. Your draw should now look like this:
<p>
<pre>
def draw():
    background("#000000")
    for f in faces:
        f.update()
        f.draw()
</pre>
<p>
Woah, it is moving! This illusion happens because for each frame, the window
is completely wiped out through the call to the background function, and then 
the face is drawn at the new location. Verify this is happening by commenting out
the call to background. Now you will see the face repeatedly drawn, but shifted down
and to the left by 1 pixel each iteration.

<h3>Task</h3>
Currently, the face disappears after a while, because it moves off the screen. 
We would like to keep it bouncing inside
the window. Add in checks to the update method to reverse the appropriate velocity
when the face hits a wall, by multiplying the velocity in that dimension by -1.

<h3>Task</h3>
Abstract the velocities so they are initialized by parameters in the __init__ method, 
and augment your setup function to choose random velocities between -1 and 1 for both
the x and y dimension for each Face created. You should now have faces moving
in all directions and bouncing off of all the walls of the window.

<h2>Step 6 - Interaction</h2>
Mouse

keyboard

<h2>Things to try when all the above works</h2>
<h3>Task</h3>
The movement functionality of the Face above should really be abstracted, since
we can imagine many types of objects that could be moving around the screen.
Create a general Sprite class that only worries about the movement, and make
Face inherit from Sprite to add the draw method.
<p>
With this abstract, you can now easily create other moving objects by inheriting
from Sprite and avoid duplicating this update code in each object. Try making another
object that will.

<h3>Task</h3>
Alter your update method of the Face to change the internal pieces of the face
in a cyclic pattern. For example, the face could smile for a few timesteps, then frown,
and then go back to smiling. Or the eyeballs could be moving up and down, left and right.

<h3>Task</h3>
Learn how to import images into your Processing sketch, and make them move around the
screen as we did with the Face above.

<h3>Task</h3>
Learn about rotations and translations, and how these can be applied to your images.
