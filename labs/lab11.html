<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 11<br>Die Hard III</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
  This lab will combine
  mathematics, instantiable classes, and bone-chilling terror. ;) Always
  a famous puzzle in the Artifical Intelligence circles, the WaterJug
  came to popular culture through the classic action
  movie <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Die+Hard%3A+With+a+Vengeance+(1995)">Die Hard III</A>.
  In Die Hard III, a mad bomber is chasing Bruce Willis
  and Samuel L. Jackson.  They must solve different puzzles or else
  things will explode and people will die.

  <H3>Example</H3>
  <p>
  The WaterJug puzzle can be explained as follows:<br>
  You have two jugs, A and B, and an infinite supply of water. There are
  three types of actions that you can use: (1) you can fill a jug to capacity,
  (2) you
  can completely empty a jug, and (3) you can pour from one jug to the other.
  Pouring from one jug to the other stops when the first jug is empty
  or the second jug is full, whichever comes first. For example, if A
  has 5 gallons and B has 6 gallons and a capacity of 8, then pouring
  from A to B leaves B full and 3 gallons in A.
  <p>
  For this demonstration, we'll state that A has capacity 4 and
  B has capacity 3.  Our goal, which we must complete in less than one
  minute, is to somehow get exactly 2 gallons of water in jug A.  We need
  to find a set of operations, filling, emptying, and pouring, where
  we can reach this goal.  One possible solution is as follows:
  <p>
  FILL A<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  EMPTY B<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  FILL A<br>
  POUR from A to B<br>
  <p>
  We now have exactly 2 gallons of water jug A.  (Try it!).  Phew, we're
  still alive!  Wouldn't it be nice to have a computer program to help us
  solve this?

  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>
  Each WaterJug will need to have two components that we can think of as the state
  of that WaterJug.
  <p>
  components:
  <UL>an integer for <code>capacity</code><br>
  an integer for <code>contents</code><br>
  </UL>
  <p>
  Also, a WaterJug needs some functionality to change the state of the internal components.
  In object-oriented programming, these are called methods.
  <p>
  methods:
  <UL><code>__init__( capacity, contents )</code> constructor method<br>
  <code>__str__( )</code> to print off the components of the WaterJug<br>
  <code>fill( )</code> to fill up the WaterJug completely<br>
  <code>empty( )</code> to completely empty the WaterJug<br>
  <code>pour( other )</code> to pour as much of the contents of this WaterJug into the other as are allowed<br>
  </UL><p>
  Implement this object in Python. Don't forget where to use the <code>self</code> keyword.
  Be careful with your methods, and also with your constructor,
  to make sure a malicious programmer cannot violate the integrity of your class.
  <p>
  Write a small main method to test that your WaterJug object works according to
  the description above.

  <h2>Puzzle Implementation</h2>
  Finally, implement a main function that allows the user to set up and then
  solve a WaterJugs puzzle.  Your function should:
  <UL>
  <li>Ask the user the capacity of the first WaterJug
  <li>Ask the user the capacity of the second WaterJug
  <li>Ask the user the goal quantity of water
  <li>Create the necessary empty WaterJug objects
  <li>While the goal has not been met:
  <ul>
  	 <li>Give the user a list of the 6 options in the game
  	 <li>Ask the user for their option selection
  	 <li>Perform the selected option
  </ul>
  <li>When the goal is met, print the solution path found by the user to reach the goal
  </ul>
 <p>
 Make sure you are consistent in the way that you tell the user to select an option.
 Whatever they type in, your code must be robust enough to handle and prompt them
 again when they make input errors.
 <p>
You never know when a Python class
  could save your life.  And remember, "Think fast, Look alive,
  Die hard."

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>
Turn in your code via Moodle. Make sure
you have followed the <a href="../python_style_guide.html">Python Style Guide</a>, and
have run your project through the Automated Style Checker.<p>
You must hand in:
<ul>
 	<li>waterjug.py
</ul>
