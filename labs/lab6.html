<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab we will make extensive use of sentinel loops (while loops).  We will explore
mutation of DNA through playing the game Doublets.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="../data/english2.txt">Common English Words</a>
	<li><a href="../code/dictionary.py">dictionary.py</a> Python Module
	<li>Lab Partner (you must have a lab partner for this lab)
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
As we study computation and life, we can ask "How did life evolve from single-celled organisms 
into the diversity of life we
see today?"  The answer lies in a process called
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation">mutation</a>.
<p>
Separate from the DNA-RNA-Protein process are two separate processes for cell duplication called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis">mitosis</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis">meiosis</a>.  Both processes involve
a cell replicating its DNA, and it is within this replication that mutations can occur.
Perhaps there was a copying mistake, or a random x-ray damaged part of the DNA;
in any case, the DNA code we begin with can undergo small alterations.  Each mutation
during this replication process could possibly have a large impact of the earlier transcription
and translation process, such that we could have a new stop codon within a gene, 
or we could place a different amino acid into our protein chain.  While some changes may be
very harmful and lead to genetic diseases, others could provide an unexpected benefit and 
new functionality. These underlying mutations 
introduce variety into the gene pool for a population, and allow natural selection 
and evolution to occur.
<p>
While the language of DNA was not understood until 1953 by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_and_Crick">James Watson and Francis Crick</a>
with the help of data from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin">Rosalind
Franklin</a>, similar properties of mutation were noticed nearly 100 years earlier by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll">Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll)
</a>, who is most famous for his novel "Alice in Wonderland." In an article for 
<i>Vanity Fair</i>, Carroll created a puzzle called Doublets, which explored the 
effects of mutation on English words.  His rules description is as follows:
<blockquote>
The rules of the Puzzle are simple enough. Two words are proposed, of the same length; 
and the Puzzle consists in linking these together by interposing other words, 
each of which shall differ from the next word in one letter only. That is to say, 
one letter may be changed in one of the given words, then one letter in the word so 
obtained, and so on, till we arrive at the other given word. The letters must not be 
interchanged among themselves, but each must keep to its own place. As an example, 
the word 'head' may be changed into 'tail' by interposing the words 
'heal, teal, tell, tall'. I call the given words 'a Doublet', the interposed words 
'Links', and the entire series 'a Chain', of which I here append an example:
<p>
<pre>
H E A D
h e a l
t e a l
t e l l
t a l l
T A I L
</pre>
<p>
It is, perhaps, needless to state that it is de rigueur that the links should be 
English words, such as might be used in good society.
</blockquote>
<p>
(More details on the connection between Lewis Carroll and genetics can be found in an article by
David B. Searls entitled <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10665270152530881">
From <i>Jabberwocky</i> to Genome: Lewis Carroll and Computational Biology</a>).
<p>
Our task for this lab is to create a Python program that lets a user play the Doublets game
and enforces all the rules given above by Lewis Carroll.

<h3>Step 1 - Analyze the Problem, Create Specifications</h3>
We will tackle this puzzle using the software engineering phases.  
First, analyze the problem to see what steps we can take to model this inside a computer.  
Try to answer the following questions: 
<ul>
	<li>What input do we need from the user? Output for the user?
	<li>What are all the possible ways that the user could enter incorrect data? 
	<li>Is there any data input from the user we need to standardize?
	<li>How can we keep track of the solution path?
</ul>
<p>
Next, make a detailed list of all the functions you think you will need to write for
this problem. Be sure to record their parameters and return value with a description
of what the function does.
<p>
Write your answers in <code>Lab Evaluation</code>.
<h3>Step 2 - Develop Pseudocode</h3> With your analysis from answering
these questions, develop an algorithmic solution using
<i>pseudocode</i>.  This should correspond to the structure of a
Python program, but is written in English instead of Python.  For
example, here is a small example of what your pseudocode should look like:
<pre>
while the user's input is not valid:
    prompt the user for input
    if n is bigger than q:
        check whether the user's input is a valid English word
        increment n
    else:
        print an error message about kittens
</pre>
The point is that this is <i>structured</i> like Python, using
indentation, while loops, and conditionals.  But the individual pieces
are just English descriptions, which you will later translate into
precise Python code.

<p>

To demonstrate the eventual behavior of the program, here is a
sample run of the Doublets game.
<p>
<pre>
What is the starting word? CAT
What is the ending word? DOG
Start   = CAT
Current = CAT
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 3
What is your new character? B
Current = CAB
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 2
What is your new character? O
Current = COB
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 3
What is your new character? G
Current = COG
End     = DOG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 1
What is your new character? D
Solution path found in 4 steps.
CAT -> CAB -> COB -> COG -> DOG
</pre>
<p>
A second run of the program is shown below, where the user made many mistakes.
<p>
<pre>
What is the starting word? log
What is the ending word? worm
The lengths are not equal. Please try again.
What is the ending word? sfu
sfu is not a word. Please try again.
What is the ending word? bug
Start   = LOG
Current = LOG
End     = BUG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 0
0 is out of range. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 4
4 is out of range. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 1
What is your new character? 4
4og is not a valid word
Current = LOG
End     = BUG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 1
What is your new character? b
Current = BOG
End     = BUG
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) x
x is not a number. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 2
What is your new character? uu
uu is more than one character. Please try again.
Which character do you want to change? (the first character is 1) 2
What is your new character? u
Solution path found in 2 steps.
LOG -> BOG -> BUG
</pre>
<p>
Add the pseudocode to your <code>Lab Evaluation</code>.
<p>

<h3>Step 3 - Implement Incrementally</h3>
Download the text file <code><a href="../data/english2.txt">english2.txt</a></code> 
and the python module <code>
<a href="../code/dictionary.py">dictionary.py</a></code> files to your working directory.
The dictionary module contains one function 
<code>valid_word(word, file)</code>, which will return True if the word is found in the file and
False otherwise.
<p>
Now take your pseduocode description and begin to implement your program in Python.  
Your program should be named <code>doublets.py</code>.  Make sure to import the dictionary module 
before trying to use the valid_word function.
Write your code in small sections and test incrementally.
<p>The approach we will take is to start with 
your basic functions and build your program from the bottom up.  Write each function 
individually and then test to make sure it will provide the functionality you need. 
In this way you will gradually build your whole Python program and know that each piece will
work as you need.

<h3>Step 4 - Test, Debug and Maintain</h3>
With incremental implementation, Steps 3 and 4 should go hand in hand.  Never write more than 
5-10 lines of code before testing your changes.  First make your program work with perfect
input, and then expand it to work with erroneous user input.
<p>
Once your program is working, try out some of the transformations below
<ul>
<li>FIRE -- HEAT
<li>SLEEP -- DREAM
<li>APE -- MAN
<li>WHITE -- BLACK
</ul>

<h3>Future Thoughts</h3>
Your <code>doublets.py</code> program lets the user chose what character to change at each step,
and then verifies that each new word is a valid word.  Can you think of a way to always find the
minimum number of steps to transform one word to another?  How will you know if a path
between two words can be found?
