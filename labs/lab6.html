<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 6<br>Going on Vacation</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
As we have learned more about the elements of coding in Python, our programs
have grown more interesting, yet more complicated and fragile. In this lab, we 
examine the benefits of using functions to structure our code.

<h2>Description</h2>
There are many versions of a word game where one person has a secret and the other players
must guess this secret. Sometimes called 
<a href="https://www.thegamegal.com/2010/11/11/green-glass-doors/">Green Glass Doors</a>,
<a href="https://www.thegamegal.com/2011/06/11/going-on-a-picnic/">Going on a picnic</a>, or 
<a href="http://www.writing.com/main/handler/item_id/1528109-Deep-but-Not-Profound">
Deep but not profound</a>, the other players can ask if certain words are part of the secret, and 
the first player must answer "yes" or "no". We have implemented a version of this game
in Python where the secret is that all of the words must have double letters to be 
accepted. Our code is written using input, output, math, conditionals, and while loops, but
without functions.
<p>
Download the text file <code><a href="../data/english2.txt">english2.txt</a></code> 
and the python module <code>
<a href="../code/dictionary.py">dictionary.py</a></code> files to your working directory.
The dictionary module contains two functions
<code>valid_word(word, file)</code>, which will return True if the word is found in the file and
False otherwise, and
<code>random_valid_word(word, file)</code>, which will return a random valid word from the
given file.
<p>
Then, download the <a href="../code/vacation.py">vacation.py</a> program to your 
working directory. Open up this file and run the code to understand how
the game works. Examine the code to determine how the goals of the game
are accomplished through programming.
<p>
Your task in this lab is to transform this code into a well-structured program
using functions. Work your way step-by-step through the following instructions to 
slowly abstract critical information into sensible functions. Each function you 
write should be localized and focused. Place these new functions at the top of your
program file as they are written.

<h3>Step 1 - Double Letter Words</h3>
Our program must determine if a given string follows the rule for the game,
namely that it has two adjacent letters that are identical. This can be found
<b>four</b> times in the current code.
<p>
Write a function called <code>has_double</code>, based on the
repeated code you find in the program, with a string called 
<code>word</code> as a parameter, which will return True if the word has the 
double letter property, and False otherwise.
<p>
Then, replace the repeated code with a call to this function in all four
places.

<h3>Step 2 - Yes/No Answers</h3> 
Identify the <b>two</b> places in the program where the user is asked a Yes/No question.
<p>
Write a function called <code>answered_yes</code> with a string called
<code>prompt</code> as a parameter, which will return True when the user
types in "Yes" (under any capitalization scheme), and returns False when
the user types in "No". If the user did not type "Yes" or "No", they should
be given another opportunity to enter input.
<p>
Replace the repeated code with a call to this function in all 
places.

<h3>Step 3 - Finding Words</h3>
To start the game, notice the code that prints out two initial words,
one that follows the vacation rule, and one that does not.
<p>
Write a function called <code>find_word</code> that abstracts this similar code.
There will be two parameters to this function, a string for the <code>wordfile</code> for 
looking up the words, and a Boolean for <code>positive</code>, which determines if the
function should return a word that positively matches the rule or one that negatively 
does not fit the rule. The function should return a string that is the eventual found word.
<p>
Replace the code in the program with your new function, using the 
parameters to distinguish between requesting an allowed and forbidden word.

<h3>Step 4 - Challenge Function</h3>
The central while loop for the game looks rather complicated. However,
there is a natural section of code related to the Challenge portion of the 
game that can be extracted into a function.
<p>
Also, the challenge is hard-coded to have exactly 6 questions asked of the user. 
This is known as having a "magic number" in our code, something that keeps on 
being used and is very specific.
<p>
Write a function called <code>passes_challenge</code>, that extracts this 
challenge code. It should have two parameters, a string for the <code>wordfile</code> for 
looking up the words, and an integer <code>n</code> to determine the 
number of times the challenge should ask the user a question. It will return
True if the user successfully passed the challenge and is worthy of winning,
and False if they answered any of the questions incorrectly.
<p>
The code related to printing out the results from the challenge should be left
in the original while loop and not be part of the function.

<h3>Step 5 - Refine Code Structure</h3>
We need to separate the code that plays the game from the code that will
repeatedly ask the user if they want to play again.
<p>
Write a function called <code>completed_game</code> that will tell the user 
the rules of the game, then repeatedly ask them for a word. If the user types in 
"QUIT", then the while loop should terminate and the function should return False.
If they successfully pass the challenge, the function should return True.
<p>
Replace the game portion of the code with a call to the above function, using
the return value appropriately.

<h3>Step 6 - Create a Main Function</h3>
With much of the rest of our code in functions, it makes sense to structure
the whole program within a function, that is invoked at the end of our file.
This helps us reduce the dependence of each piece on any global variables.
<p>
Write a function called <code>main</code> that has no parameters or return value.
The body of this function should be all of the remaining code that is not already 
in a function.
<p>
Then, add a single call to main at the end of your file. Your code should look
something like this
<p>
<pre>
def main():
   ...
   ...
   ...
   
main()
</pre>

<h3>Step 7 - Determining Word Validity</h3>
The while loop in the <code>completed_game</code> function is doing two 
tasks: First it is cycling through until the user either wins or quits. But at the 
same time, it is determining the validity of the user's word in the dictionary. These
two tasks should be separated.
<p>
Write a function called <code>get_user_word</code> that has a string called <code>prompt</code>
as a first parameter and the wordfile as the second. This code should repeatedly
ask the user to enter a word, until the word can be successfully validated
in the dictionary. The function should return the valid word.
<p>
Then, rewrite the original while loop for the game. The first thing the loop should 
do is make a call to your <code>get_user_word</code> function and save the
result as input. The internal conditions of the while loop now can be enumerated
so that it determines if input is "CHALLENGE", "QUIT", or otherwise needs to determine
if the word fits the double letter rule.

<h3>Step 8 - Biased Challenge Word Selection</h3>
Our challenge currently requests words from the dictionary randomly, and it is
very likely that the user will not see words that have any repeated letters since they
are more rare in the dictionary.
<p>
Rewrite the <code>passes_challenge</code> function to randomly make a choice each time
between a positive and a negative word. You should use the <code>find_word</code> function
written above in step 3 to look up the correct category of word one the category 
has been randomly determined.

<h3>Step 9 - Random Rule Selection </h3>
If a user plays our game and wins, they have little incentive to play
again, since they have already learned the secret rule.
<p>
As a final task, code at least two other functions similar to 
<code>has_double</code> that bring in a string as a
parameter, and returns True if the given word matches some
syntactic property, such as the first and last letters are the same,
or the word has more vowels than consonants.
<p>
Now within the <code>main</code> function, write a set of 
if statements to randomly select one of these functions as the
particular rule to use in the game.
<p>
You will need to pass this function as an argument throughout the code
you have written. This function will be 
needed in the <code>completed_game</code> function, the 
<code>find_word</code> function, and the <code>passes_challenge</code> function.
<p>
You will also need to pass along a string into the <code>completed_game</code>
function that describes in English the selected rule.
