<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 8<br>Fractal Recursion</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Certain elements of mathematics can be naturally described by recursion, as we saw with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a> function.  Today, we will 
practice tracing function call and look
into the mathematics of fractals and how some of their properties can be described with recursion.

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">Turtle module</a>
</ul>

<h2>Function Tracing</h2>
Tracing through the execution of a recursive function can help with understanding how 
recursion can subdivide a problem by reusing the same code. Here we will practice with
two such recursive functions. 
<h3>Step 1</h3>

<pre>
def divider(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + divider(n // 2)
</pre>
<p>
In your Evaluation Document, trace the execution of three separate executions of the
divider function by creating a table of the input parameters and return value for each level of recursion.
<ul>
<li><code>divider(2)</code> 
<li><code>divider(5)</code> 
<li><code>divider(10)</code> 
</ul>
How many times was the function
called in each instance?
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<pre>
def swapper(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return swapper(b, a % b)
</pre>
<p>
In your Evaluation Document, trace the execution of two separate executions of the <code>swapper</code> 
function by creating a table of the input parameters and return value for each level of recursion.
<ul>
<li><code>swapper(6, 8)</code> 
<li><code>swapper(13, 8)</code> 
</ul>
How many times was the function
called in each instance?


<h2>Fractals</h2>
Next, we will be using Python's <code>Turtle</code> module to draw fractals such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle">Sierpinski's
Triangle</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch
Snowflake</a>, and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve">Dragon Curve</a>.
Fractals have also been employed for modeling natural phenomena, 
most especially <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop">
plants</a>.
<p>
To access the <code>Turtle</code> module and define a turtle, you
can use the following lines of code:
<p>
<pre>
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
</pre>
<p>
By calling methods on the variable <code>t</code>, we can make the
turtle navigate around the screen and draw lines.  (If you want to
know why it is called a "turtle", you can read
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)">turtles</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Seymour Papert</a>.)
<p>
Some turtle commands you might find useful:
<ul>
<li>movement around the screen: <code>t.forward(n)</code>
and <code>t.back(n)</code> will move the turtle forward or
backwards <code>n</code> pixels in the current
direction. <code>t.goto(x, y)</code> will go to a particular location
on the screen.
<li>changing
direction: <code>t.right(d)</code>, <code>t.left(d)</code> will turn
the turtle left or right by <code>d</code> degrees.
<li>draw a dot on the screen of a certain size: <code>t.dot(size)</code>
<li>put the pen down or pick the pen up: <code>t.penup(),
    t.pendown()</code>
<li>change the turtle's speed: <code>t.speed(s)</code>, where 1 =
  slowest and 10 = fastest
</ul>
There are lots of other turtle commands, and you are free to use any
of them you like; see
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html">Turtle
  module documentation</a>.
<h3>Step 3</h3>

The first type of fractal we will examine uses a simple rewrite rule.
The idea is to replace a straight line segment with four smaller line
segments, each 1/3 the length of the original, as shown below.

<p>
<img src="../images/koch.png">
<p>
(Note that the angles are 60 and 120 degrees; the green turtle shows
where the turtle starts and the red turtle shows where it ends.)  If
we repeat this replacement operation, again replacing each of the four
line segments, we obtain something like this:
<p>
  <img src="../images/koch-iter2.png">
<p>
Continuing to repeat this process yields an ever more detailed
"snowflake" curve.  For example, here is the result after iterating 4 times:
<p>
  <img src="../images/koch-iter4.png">
<p>
  In a file called <code>fractal.py</code>, type in the following 
recursive function:
<pre>
import turtle

def koch(t, n, size):
    if n == 0:
        t.forward(size)
    else:
        koch(t, n - 1, size / 3)
        t.left(60)
        koch(t, n - 1, size / 3)
        t.right(120)
        koch(t, n - 1, size / 3)
        t.left(60)
        koch(t, n - 1, size / 3)
</pre>

<p>
This function uses the turtle object <code>t</code> to draw an 
order-<code>n</code> Koch curve, that is, the result of iterating 
this process <code>n</code>
times.  In the base case (when <code>n == 0</code>), it simply
draws a line of length <code>size</code>; in the recursive case, it 
draws four smaller copies of an order-(<code>n - 1</code>) Koch curve,
arranged as shown in the replacement rule above.
<p>
Once you have typed in the function, test it as follows:
<pre>
>>> t = turtle.Turtle()
>>> t.speed(10)
>>> t.penup()
>>> t.goto(0, -100)
>>> t.pendown()
>>> koch(t, 1, 100)
>>> t.penup()
>>> t.goto(0, 0)
>>> t.pendown()
>>> koch(t, 2, 100)
>>> t.penup()
>>> t.goto(0, 100)
>>> t.pendown()
>>> koch(t, 3, 100)
>>> t.penup()
>>> t.goto(0, 200)
>>> t.pendown()
>>> koch(t, 4, 100)
</pre>

<p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
In your Lab Evalution Document, answer the following questions:
<ol>
<li> What is the visible effect of increasing the order of the curve?
<li> As we did in Steps 1 and 2, 
trace the execution of <code>koch(t, 2, 100)</code> 
by creating a table of the input parameters and return value for each level of recursion.
Note that the function is called multiple times for each level. The table 
for <code>koch(t, 1, 100)</code> would look like
<p>
<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">Level</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">t</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">n</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">size</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">t</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">1</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">1.1<br></td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">t</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">33.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">1.2</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">t</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">33.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">1.3</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">t</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">33.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">1.4</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">t</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">0</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">33.3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
<li> How does recursion cause this effect? In your answer, be sure
to discuss how the different argument values at each level of recursion
affect the behavior of the turtle and the appearance of the drawing.
</ol>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
Try your recursive coding skills out with curves
generated by the replacement shown below. Write a function called
<code>koch2(t, n, size)</code> that draws the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quadratic_Koch_2.png">Koch 2</a>
fractal.
<p>
<img src="../images/koch2.png">
<h3>Step 5</h3>
Now do the same thing for the following replacements:
<p>
<p>
Write a function called <code>koch3(t, n, size)</code> that draws the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quadratic_Koch.png">Koch 3</a>
fractal.
<p>
  <img src="../images/koch3.png">
<p>
Note that in the middle of the above replacement pattern there is a
  long vertical segment. This can either be replaced by a single
  half-sized copy, or by two quarter-sized copies.  These different
  methods yield different (but related) fractals.  Use whichever one
  you like better!  For the C-curve below, however, the bottom segment
  really does need two half-size copies (hence the dot in the middle),
  instead of a single full-size copy; otherwise it will look pretty
  boring.
<p>
Write a function called <code>c_curve(t, n, size)</code> that draws the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levy_C_construction.png">C-curve</a>
fractal.
<p>
  <img src="../images/c-curve.png">
<p>
Note the direction the turtle is facing at the beginning and end of
  the replacement above!
<p>
<h3>Step 6</h3>
These next two are a little different. They each <b>require two functions</b> for
replacement instead of just one above.  The first function is
indicated by blue lines, and the second function by orange lines.  (The
color simply distinguishes the functions; you do not need to draw
colored lines.)
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dragon_curve_iterations_(2).svg">Dragon Curve</a>
<p>
<img src="../images/dragon.png">
<p>
Note that the above replacements are drawn to scale: the distance
between the start and end points are the same.  The blue and orange
lines make a right angle.  You should think about the question: what
should be the length of the blue and orange lines at the bottom (after
replacement), relative to the length of the lines at the top (before
replacement)?
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Serpinski_Lsystem.svg">Sierpinski's Triangle</a>
<p>
<img src="../images/sierpinski.png">
<p>
This one is a bit strange since the turtle ends up facing in a
different direction after the replacement.  Just go with it!  Also,
for this one the relative lengths are not as important; they will just
determine how big the final Sierpinski triangle gets.

<h3>Step 7</h3>
Create your own replacement rule for your personal
fractal, and write code to draw it!  In your Lab Evaluation Document, 
describe what you expected to happen when you planned your fractal,
and discuss how your expectations were (or were not) met after it
executed.
