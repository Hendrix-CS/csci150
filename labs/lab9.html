<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Sentiment Analysis is a Big Data problem which seeks to determine the
general attitude of a writer given some text they have written. For
instance, we would like to have a program that could look at the text
"The film was a breath of fresh air" and realize that it was a
positive statement, while "It made me want to poke out my eyeballs" is
negative.</p>

<p>
One algorithm that we can use for this is to assign a numeric value to
any given word based on how positive or negative that word is and then
score the statement based on the values of the words. But, how do we
come up with our word scores in the first place? </p>

<p>
That's the problem that we'll solve in this assignment. You are going
to search through a file containing movie reviews from the Rotten
Tomatoes website which have both a numeric score as well as
text. You'll use this to learn which words are positive and which are
negative. The <a href="../data/movieReviews.txt">data file</a> looks
like this:
</p>

<pre>
1 A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
4 This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
1 Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
3 A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .
1 Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
4 A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .
1 Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .
3 The Importance of Being Earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations
1 But it does n't leave you with much .
1 You could hate it for the same reason .
...
</pre>

Note that each review starts with a number 0 through 4 with the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>0 : negative</li>
<li>1 : somewhat negative</li>
<li>2 : neutral</li>
<li>3 : somewhat positive</li>
<li>4 : positive</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Word scoring</h2>

To start, you will write a program that simply prompts the user for a
word, then reads through entire review database and computes the
average score of all reviews containing the word.

Specifically, you should write two
functions: <tt>score_word(word)</tt> and <tt>score_user_word()</tt>.

The first function, <tt>score_word(word)</tt>, should:
<ul>
  <li>Open the <tt>movieReviews.txt</tt> file, loop through it, and
    compute the average rating for reviews containing the given word.</li>
  <li>Return the average rating, or <tt>None</tt> if the word does
    not occur in any reviews.</li>
</ul>

Some hints:
<ul>
  <li><tt>score_word</tt> should not prompt the user or print
    anything!</li>
  <li>Use the string <tt>split()</tt> method to split each line of the
  file into words.  If <tt>words = line.split()</tt>,
  then <tt>words[0]</tt> will be the review score,
    and <tt>words[1:]</tt> will be all the words in the review.</li>
  <li>The average rating for a word can be computed as the total score
    of reviews containing the word, divided by the number of reviews
    containing the word.</li>
  <li>Be careful to handle words with different capitalizations, for
    example, by converting everything to lowercase.</li>
  <li>Be careful to look only for <i>entire</i> words.  For example,
  the word "bad" does not occur in the review <tt>"This is a movie
  about a troubadour."</tt>, even though the letters "bad" do occur as
  a substring.  The easiest way to deal with this is to split the
  review into a list of words, and check whether the given word exists as
  an element of the list (for example, using Python's <tt>in</tt>
    operator).</li>
  <li>Even if the word occurs multiple times in a review, you should
    only count the review once. (You probably don't have to do
    anything special to make this work; you will get this behavior by
    default if you just check for the presence of the word in the
    review.)
</ul>

The second function, <tt>score_user_word()</tt>, should:
<ul>
  <li>Prompt the user for a word.</li>
  <li>Call <tt>score_word</tt> to compute the average score for
    ratings containing the user's word.</li>
  <li>Report the average rating to the user, along with an an
    assessment whether the word is positive (score greater than 2) or
    negative (score less than or equal to 2).</li>
</ul>

For example, here is some sample output from
calling <tt>score_user_word</tt> three times:

<pre>
>>> score_user_word()
Please enter a word: <span>cat</span>
Score: 3.16666666667
Positive! =)
>>> score_user_word()
Please enter a word: <span>CAt</span>
Score: 3.16666666667
Positive! =)
>>> score_user_word()
Please enter a word: <span>koala</span>
Sorry, that word is not in the database.
</pre>

<h2>Step 2: Phrase scoring</h2>

In this step, you will score an entire phrase instead of a single
word.  Again, you should write two functions:

<ul>
  <li><tt>score_phrase(phrase)</tt> should split the given phrase into
  words, call <tt>score_word</tt> on each, and compute the average
  score of the whole phrase.  (Be careful to handle words resulting
    in <tt>None</tt>---they should not contribute to the
    average.)</li>

  <li><tt>score_user_phrase</tt>, similarly
  to <tt>score_user_word</tt>, should prompt the user for a phrase,
  and tell the user its average score along with whether it is
    positive or negative.</li>
</ul>

For example:

<pre>
>>> score_user_phrase()
Please enter a word or phrase: <span>My helicopter is full of eels</span>
Score: 2.12112861734
Positive! =)
>>> score_user_phrase()
Please enter a word or phrase: <span>It made me want to poke out my eyeballs</span>
Score: 1.76536704587
Negative. =(
>>> score_user_phrase()
Please enter a word or phrase: <span>I am flying higher than a kite</span>
Score: 2.42411951303
Positive! =)
>>> score_user_phrase()
Please enter a word or phrase: <span>Koala refectory disentanglements</span>
Sorry, none of those words are in the database.
</pre>

You will probably notice a slight lag between entering a phrase and
seeing its score.  This is because your program has to re-open and
re-read the <i>entire</i> movie review database for <i>each</i> word!
As an experiment, try entering a phrase like "a a a a a a a a a a a a
a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a", with many small
words.  The more words you enter, the longer your program will take,
even if the words are all the same.  There has to be a better way!

<h2>Step 3: Dictionaries to the rescue!</h2>

<p>
Instead of reading through the whole review database for each word, we
would like to read the database only <i>once</i>, when the program
starts, and pre-compute the score for every word that appears.  We can
then save these word scores in a dictionary, so we can quickly look up
the score for any word without re-reading the entire database.</p>

<p>
First, write a function <tt>read_movie_reviews(review_file)</tt>,
which takes the name of the movie review file as a parameter, and
returns a dictionary mapping from words to their average scores.  The
basic idea is to loop through the reviews in the file while keeping
track of <i>two</i> dictionaries: one maps from words to
a <i>count</i> of how many reviews each word has appeared in; the
other maps from words to the <i>total score</i> of reviews the word
has appeared in.</p>

<p>Hints:
<ul>
  <li>For each line in the database, you want to count each unique
    word only once. The easiest way to do this is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Convert the line to lowercase</li>
      <li>Split the line into words using <tt>.split()</tt></li>
      <li>Remove any duplicate words by converting to a <tt>set</tt> and
      back: <tt>list(set(...))</tt>.
    </ul>
    For example, you might write something like
    <pre>
line = line.lower()
words = line.split()
for word in list(set(words[1:])):
  ...
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<!-- XXX For example, -->

<p>
After going through the whole file in this way, divide the total score
for each word by the number of reviews in which it appears to derive
the average score for the word.</p>

<p>
Next, write a function <tt>score_phrase_dict(word_scores,
    phrase)</tt>, which works similarly to <tt>score_phrase</tt>, but
    uses the dictionary <tt>word_scores</tt> of computed scores
    instead of looking through the review data each time.  <i>Hint</i>: you
    can just copy your code from <tt>score_phrase</tt> and modify it
    to use the dictionary instead of calling <tt>score_word</tt>.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Main</h2>

<p>Write a <tt>main()</tt> function which
calls <tt>read_movie_reviews</tt> to create a word score dictionary,
then repeatedly prompts user for phrases and scores them.  Include a
call to <tt>main()</tt> at the bottom of your program so it runs
  automatically.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what the output from your program might look
like:</p>
<pre>
Reading movie reviews...
Please enter a phrase, or quit: <span>My helicopter is full of eels</span>
Score: 2.12112861734
Positive! =)
Please enter a phrase, or quit: <span>It made me want to poke out my eyeballs</span>
Score: 1.76536704587
Negative. =(
Please enter a phrase, or quit: <span>I am flying higher than a kite</span>
Score: 2.42411951303
Positive! =)
Please enter a phrase, or quit: <span>Koala refectory disentanglements</span>
Sorry, none of those words are in the database.
Please enter a phrase, or quit: <span>quit</span>
Goodbye!
</pre>

<h2>Step 5: Word score caching</h2>

There is still probably a noticeable lag when your program starts,
while it reads the movie reviews and constructs the dictionary of word
scores.  We can make it even faster by <i>caching</i> the word score
data in another file so it does not have to be recomputed next time
the program runs.

For this step, modify your <tt>main</tt> function so it does the
following:

<ul>
  <li>Take the given name of the movie review database file and
  append <tt>.cache</tt> to it.  For example, if the movie review file
  is <tt>movies.txt</tt>, the name of the cache file will
    be <tt>movies.txt.cache</tt>.</li>
  <li>Check whether this cache file exists.  You can do this by
  adding <tt>import os</tt> at the top of your program and then using
  the <tt>os.path.isfile</tt> function, which takes a file name as an
    argument and returns a boolean.</li>
  <li>If the cache file does not exist, read the movie review database
    and construct the word score dictionary using
    the <tt>read_movie_reviews</tt> function as usual.
    Then <i>write</i> the contents of the dictionary to the cache file
    using the format
    <pre>
word1 score1
word2 score2
word3 score3
...
  </pre></li>
  For example, the first few lines of the generated cache file might look like
  <pre>
aided 4.0
writings 1.0
bad-boy 2.0
ryoko 2.0
yellow 1.5
pony 0.0
four 2.08695652174
  </pre>
  <li>If the cache file <i>does</i> exist, then read it instead of the
    movie reviews, putting the data directly into a dictionary of word
    scores.</li>
  <li>In either case, return the created dictionary of word scores.</li>
</ul>
(Of course, you probably don't want to do all of that directly in
your <tt>main</tt> function; you should decompose the behavior into
more functions as appropriate.)

<p>This procedure means that the work to
compute the dictionary of word scores from the movie reviews will be
done only once, the first time your program runs.  On subsequent runs,
the word scores will be read directly from the cache file.  This
should be noticeably faster, since the cache file will be smaller than
the movie review file, and requires no computation while reading it.</p>
