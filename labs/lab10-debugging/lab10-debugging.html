<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 10<br>On Stuckness and Debugging</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

As you certainly know by now, finding and fixing errors is an integral
part of programming.  If anything, this becomes <i>more</i> so, not
less, the more experienced of a programmer you become (although the
types of errors you have to fix may get more sophisticated).

<p>
It is thus worthwhile to practice and reflect on the process of
debugging itself.  Debugging is, in a very real sense,
an <b>application of the scientific method</b>: one makes
observations, collects data, comes up with hypotheses, designs
experiments to test the hypotheses, and so on.  But, as we will see,
as with any science, debugging is not <b>only</b> an application of
the scientific method.  In addition to "classic"-style objective
analysis, it also often requires "romantic"-style intuitive
insights---but you can develop this romantic intuition, over time, by
conscious application.

<!-- expand above into more detailed discussion? -->

<p>
This lab will give you some directed practice in finding and fixing
programming errors, and help you reflect on the practice of debugging.

<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Sum practice</h3>

<p>
<a href="../static/sum-practice.py"><tt>sum-practice.py</tt></a>
contains several errors.  Specifically, it contains several syntax
errors, a runtime error, and a logic error.  Your task for this step
is to find and correct these errors.

<p>
<b>For each fix, you should add a comment to the file explaining what
  was wrong and how you fixed it.</b>  For example, if the file
contained

<pre>
...
x = random.random(
...
</pre>

<p>
you should change it to something like the following:

<pre>
...
# Fixed syntax error: added missing closing )
x = random.random()
...
</pre>

<p>
First, try to run the program and look at the generated error(s). Fix
the syntax errors in the file by looking at the line numbers in your
program that Python specifies.  (Hint: the error message is not always
exactly right about the cause of the error!)

<p>
After you fix the syntax errors in the program, you will see a runtime
error.  Carefully read the error message and look at the code.  Try to
identify the problem in the code.  Remember that small details such as
capitalization and punctuation matter a great deal in code.  If you
can't identify the source of the runtime error, ask your instructor or
TA for help.  Remember to add a comment explaining the problem and
solution.

<p>
After you fix the runtime error, try running the program
again. Success!  ...or is it?  The program SHOULD compute the sum of
the first n odd integers.  Does the program give you the correct
answer?  Double check, since you should NEVER assume the program is
giving you the correct answer just because it runs.  Indeed, you
should know what answer you expect the program to compute before you
run it.  Otherwise, how will you know if your program is correct?

<p>
Try running the program with different inputs.  If you notice a
pattern, this will give you a clue to the logic error.

<p>
Collecting data is often a key part of gaining the insight necessary
to diagnose an error.  One good way to collect data is
to <i>instrument</i> a program to generate information about
intermediate results.  In particular, let's add a statement to print
out intermediate results, every time the loop executes.  Add the
statement

<pre>
print "Adding " + str(odd) + " to the current sum " + str(sum)
</pre>

<p>
as the first line of code inside the while loop.

<p>
Run your program again.  The statement you added now prints out some
very useful information.  Printing out intermediate results inside of
a loop can be a very useful strategy for finding logic errors in your
code.  You can add more <tt>print</tt> statements if you think other
information would be useful.

<p>
Finally, fix the program so it correctly computes the sum of the first
N odd numbers, as advertised.

<h3>Step 2: Stuckness</h3>

Now that you are warmed up, let's step back and think about the
process of finding and fixing errors itself.  Read
the <a href="http://mgoadric.github.io/csci150/homework/zen.html#section2">excerpt
from "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" labeled "Section
2"</a>.  Then, together with your partner(s), answer the following
questions and write your answers in your Evaluation Document.

<ol>
  <li>What does the narrator mean by "stuckness"?</li>
  <li>Can you identify with the author's description?  In what ways
    is the narrator's description of trying to fix a motorcycle
    similar and different to your experiences in this class?</li>
  <li>What does the narrator say about the relationship between the
    traditional scientific method and being stuck?</li>
  <li>Why does the narrator say that stuckness should not be
    avoided?</li>
  <li>What do you think the narrator means by "Quality"? (I am just
    curious to know what you think; in some sense the entire book is
    about exactly this question, so I certainly don't expect you to
    come up with a complete answer!)
  <li>Did you learn anything from this reading?  Are there ways in
    which you will approach programming and debugging differently as a
    result? ("No" is an acceptable answer, but you should justify
    it!)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: Amaze your friends</h3>

<!--
Write your own program that does XYZ.  Make sure you use comments
to document what the program is SUPPOSED to do.  Now deliberately
introduce THREE bugs.  Exchange with another group.  Fix and etc.

<h3>Step 4: Guess the number</h3>

Download and save a copy
of <a href="../static/guess.py"><tt>guess.py</tt></a>.  This program
emulates a guessing game.  Here's a description of how the game is
SUPPOSED to work:

<blockquote>
The game plays five rounds. During each round, the computer picks a
random number between 1 and 6 inclusive.  (You can think of this as
rolling a 6 sided die.) The user is then given three chances to guess
the chosen number.  If the user guesses correctly, then they win a
point, otherwise the computer wins a point. At the end of five rounds,
whoever has the most points wins the game.
</blockquote>
However, the program has bugs, and it doesn't follow the rules
currently.  (As an aside, this exercise is a great example of why you
should never write a lot of code before you test and debug.  It's much
harder to debug this program now that it's "finished" then it would be
if you practiced incremental development and fixed the errors as you
went along!)  Your job is to make the program follow the above rules
by finding and correcting semantic errors.

<p>
Before looking at the code, run the program to see what it does. When
debugging a program, it is vital to collect evidence before making
changes to the code.  This helps you build a mental model of how the
code works and gives you a starting point to look for errors.
Sometimes, you can identify errors without much effort by carefully
tracing the code with the input sequence that causes an error.

<p>
<i>An important aside</i>: because the code generates a different
number each time (what fun would it be to play a game that picked the same number every 
time?), it's hard to debug.  To make the program's behavior
repeatable, we can use something called a <i>seed</i>, which starts
the random number generator in a certain state. Beginning from the
same seed, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated every
time.  (If no seed is
specified, the current time is used as a seed, which is why random
numbers are usually different every time you run a program.)  To make
the code's behavior repeatable, add the line

<pre>
random.seed(11)
</pre>

<p>
right after <tt>import random</tt>.  (There is nothing special about
the number 11; you can use any number you want.  The important point
is that your program will now use the <i>same</i> seed every time it
is run.)  Be sure to remove this line before submitting your final
corrected program; otherwise the game will be no fun!

<p>
After you have identified one (or more) incorrect behaviors, take a
look at <tt>guess.py</tt>.  You should put in <tt>print</tt>
statements like we did above to help you identify issues as you begin
to try to fix the code.  It is often useful to identify a loop or if
statement that isn't working the way you think it should, and print
out the variables in its condition immediately before the loop/if
statement executes (or doesn't execute).  This gives you an idea of
exactly why your loop/if statement is executing or not.  You can then
alter the variable to make the behavior correct.  After making a
correction or adding more <tt>print</tt> statements, run the program
again and observe the behavior.  Remember to add a comment explaining
each error that you fix!

<p>
Did you fix it? If yes, are there other problems?  When debugging it
is important to focus on one problem at a time.  Once you are
satisfied you've corrected that problem, then run the program again to
identify the next problem.

<p>
Continue in this way until you are satisfied that the program plays by
the rules.

<p>
You should be able to identify at least 3 semantic errors. You may
have to add more than 3 lines of code to fix these errors; however,
all the code changes required are minor.  (In other words, you will
not have to make major changes like changing levels of code.)
