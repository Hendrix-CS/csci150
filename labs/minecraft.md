# Lab 1: Introduction and Minecraft

## Overview

In this lab, you will first learn about and reflect on pair programming.
Then, you will get a first taste of programming by directing a
character's actions in the virtual world Minecraft.

## Materials

* Quotes on paper from previous courses
* [Minecraft at Code.org](http://studio.code.org/join/XGHRWB)
* Lab Partner

### Step 1

In this and the rest of the lab assignments in this course, we will be using a technique called
[pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). Two students
will work together as lab partners at one computer. One student will be the *driver*, operating the
keyboard and mouse, and the other student will be the *navigator*, giving advice
and direction. **Students will change roles frequently, every 10-15 minutes**.
If there are an odd number of students in the lab, one pair will become a trio.

Pick up a slip of paper from the instructor, containing a modified quotation from students in previous similar computer science labs. Once all students have a slip of paper, you will then be asked to read your quote aloud.

Once all students have read their comments aloud, we will talk through the implications of the situations.  

### Step 2

Now, form a small group of three to four of your peers to come up with suggestions for a **Lab Code of Conduct** for this section. If you wish, you can also submit suggestions to your lab instructor privately.  

Before next week's lab, your instructor will combine these suggestions into a single document, which you will be asked to sign. If you have concerns over the final document and are unwilling to sign, please discuss them privately with your instructor.

### Step 3

Find your assigned Lab Partner to begin pair programming.

Follow the link above and sign up for an account at Code.org. **Be
sure to use one of your Hendrix email address**, since this is the only way
we will be able to assign you a grade for this lab.  Also,
put **both partners' full names in the name field**.

Work through the stages of the Minecraft programming section. First,
just try to solve each puzzle by piecing together a valid
solution. Then, focus on being efficient in your code, as each level
has a minimum number of blocks that can be used to develop a solution.

Note that the final "open-ended" level is just for fun and does not
need to be completed in order to complete the lab.

## Submission

You do not need to do anything to submit this lab: if you accessed it
by clicking the link above, we can automatically track your progress.

## Grading

* To earn 15 points, complete the first eight stages.
* To earn 17 points, complete all of the stages (other than the final
  "open-ended" stage).
* To earn 20 points, complete all of the stages (other than the final
  one) using the minimum number of blocks.
