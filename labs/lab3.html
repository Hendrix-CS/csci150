<h1><a href="../index.html">CSCI 150</a> - Lab 3<br>Diagnosing Heart Disease</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This lab
we investigate some pieces of "intelligence," using our ability to divide objects into categories.

<hr>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.7
<li><a href="../data/cleveland-training.csv">Patient Training File</a>
<li><a href="../data/cleveland-testing.csv">Patient Testing File</a>

<h2>Description</h2>
<img class="entryimageright" src="../images/heart.jpg">While the formal system of Boolean logic was developed by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>, 
the study of logic has roots as far back as Ancient Greece and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and his foundational work on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism">Syllogisms</a>.  Our ability to reason
logically and rationally is often cited as a primary indicator of our intelligence, not only on an
individual level as measured by SAT and IQ tests, but also on a species level to distinguish our
actions and behaviors from other organisms. Today we will spend
our first lab understanding the basics of intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) is a field within computer science with the goal of recreating, through 
the user of a computer, the 
intelligence we see in human behavior. The goal of AI has yet to be achieved on a broad sense,
but much progress has been made in the fields of logic and categorization.  We tackled
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning">deductive reasoning</a> 
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_puzzle">logic puzzles</a>, 
deducing a conclusion of what must be true from the facts presented to us.  Today we'll focus on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">inductive logic</a>: our ability
to make generalizations based on data and apply these general rules to new situations.

<h3>Step 1</h3>
Imagine you are tasked by the <a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/">Cleveland Clinic</a> to 
help them train new doctors to diagnose patients with heart disease. They have been
reviewing their <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
">past patient histories</a> and started to notice some patterns after narrowing their
focus to a few key features of each patient. They show you some histograms,
where the patients with heart disease are labeled red, and those without are labeled blue.
<p>
<center><img width=700 src="../images/heart-disease-histograms.png"></center>
<p>
They also give you some more detailed information about these features.
<ul>
<li>age: age in years (integer)
<li>female: true if female patient (boolean)
<li>chest_pain: four types of chest pain were recorded (string)
	<ul>
 		<li>typical angina
 		<li>atypical angina
 		<li>non-anginal pain
 		<li>asymptomatic
 	</ul>
<li>rest_bps: resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the 
        hospital (integer)
<li>cholesterol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl (integer)
<li>high_fasting_blood_sugar: true if  > 120 mg/dl (boolean)
<li>rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results (string)
	<ul>
 		<li>normal
 		<li>wave abnormality
 		<li>hypertrophy
 	</ul>
<li>maximum_heart_rate: maximum heart rate achieved (integer)
<li>exercise_angina: exercise induced angina (boolean)
<li>vessels: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (integer)
<li>heart_disease: diagnosis of heart disease.
</ul>

The final piece of data, heart_disease, is what they would like to summarize based on 
the other 10 features.
<p>
They present you with the following ten example patients 
above, listing off their features. They would like a way to make decisions about newly admitted patients which is 
based on the information above, and simple enough for someone to remember the rule.

<p>


We will be adding our logical rules to a file called
<code>analysis.py</code>. Using what you know about <code>if-elif-else</code> statements, 
edit this python program where directed to classify a given patient.


<ol>
<li>THREE SUBSETS TO ANALYZE
</ol>
Observe the analysis results on the training set given above. How accurate is your rule?

<p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
We now wish to evaluate how your program will work on unseen data.
Test your edited <code>analysis.py</code> program with the testing data.  

<p>
<h3>What To Hand In</h3>
Hand in your files on <a href="http://moodle.hendrix.edu">Moodle</a>.  
Write up your four if-elif-else statements from step 1 in a file 
called <code>analysis.py</code>. Write the results of 
each test example in step 2 with each if-elif-else statement above into 
an evaluation document.
<p>

You must hand in:
<ul>
 	<li>analysis.py
 	<li>Lab Evaluation
</ul>
